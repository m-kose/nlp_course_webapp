The country has to move forward and the best way forward is for the coup leaders to quickly return power to the people and carry out the reforms they promised,\" he said at the time.\nHe also said he expected high standards of probity from his party and any government he led.\nGoing beyond the current transparency rules for Thai MPs, he said he would require all future Democrat Party representatives to declare their assets and any involvement in private companies.\nHowever, that has not shielded his government, or party, from corruption allegations, including claims of a cover-up of illegal donations by a petrochemical firm.\nBut the main chink in the Abhisit armour, apart from the impression that his good looks tend to outshine his sometimes rather bland political pronouncements, has been his failure to win the popular vote.\nHis acceptance of defeat in the July 2011 election has done nothing to change that.\nBefore entering parliament, Mr Abhisit had a brief academic career.

I called my best friend James Coburn, who was hanging out with a chick, smoking dope in Greenwich Village, and told him: 'Get out here fast!' He had no money, and had to borrow some from his parents. But he made it.\"\nDespite the misgivings of the entire cast who, according to Vaughn spent most of the time on set playing poker and waiting for the day's scripts to be written, The Magnificent Seven became a massive hit.\nHe then went back to television, playing a number of now forgotten roles before he was offered the title role in a new spy series, Solo which had been created, in part, by the author Ian Fleming.\nRenamed as The Man From U.N.C.L.E, the first episode, shot in black and white, aired in September 1964 with Vaughn playing secret agent Napoleon Solo alongside David McCallum as the Russian born Illya Kuryakin.\nThe series, with its tongue in cheek approach to espionage ,brought some much-needed relief to a world deep in the Cold War and became an international hit.\nIt was especially popular in Britain, where schoolboys enthusiastically sent off for U.N.C.L.E. identity cards while their sisters gave Vaughn a screaming pop star style welcome when he arrived in London on a publicity tour in 1966.\nSerious actor that he was, Vaughn had no regrets about taking on the role.\n\"Not only was it a great deal of fun, it changed me from being a working actor to a negotiating actor. After U.N.C.L.E., I never accepted the first offer: if I wanted more money, I asked for it.\"\nBy the third series a misguided attempt to introduce humour into the show resulted in excruciatingly embarrassing scenes such as Solo dancing with a gorilla. Audience numbers nosedived and the series was cancelled half way though its fourth season.\nIn 1968, Vaughn's former co-star, Steve McQueen, offered him the role of the ambitious and conniving politician, Walter Chalmers, in the film Bullitt, for which he received a Bafta nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\nOver the next three decades Vaughn appeared in a string of films, including The Towering Inferno and Superman III, as well as countless TV programmes.\nBetween 1972 and 1974 he spent a somewhat acrimonious time playing Harry Rule in the ITV series, The Protectors.\nThe plot featured three wealthy individuals getting together each week, usually in exotic locations, to solve crimes and protect the innocent.\nIt was described by Vaughn in his autobiography as \"tasteless junk\", and there were rows with the producer, Gerry Anderson, who accused Vaughn of behaving like a prima donna.\nNevertheless the show proved extremely popular and was only cancelled when a major sponsor pulled out at the end of the second series.\nAfter years of mainly forgotten parts and guest appearances his career was re-energised when he was invited to play Albert Stroller in the BBC television series, Hustle.\nTaking its inspiration from films such as, The Sting, Vaughn played an elderly con man responsible for setting up potential targets for a younger generation of grifters.\nThe format proved an immediate success particularly after the BBC brokered a lucrative deal with the US cable channel AMC.\n\"Hustle is wonderfully enjoyable, because all my life I've made an effort to be with people who can make me laugh. That original cast - Marc Warren, Jaime Murray, Robert Glenister and Adrian Lester - are all funny. So I know every day I'll have a few good laughs.\"\nWhile filming in London, Vaughn took the time to narrate and appear in a BBC Radio 4 drama on the making of the film The Bridge at Remagen, in which he had starred back in 1969.\nOff screen, Vaughn was a committed political activist who had joined the Democrats in the early 1950s while at college in Minnesota.\nFirmly on the liberal wing of the party, he became close friends with Senator Robert Kennedy and played a major part in opposition to the Vietnam War but denied rumours he had ambitions to run for political office himself.\nVaughn's acting career never reached the heights achieved by some of his contemporaries, possibly because he devoted time to his political activities.\nBut he had no regrets. \"With a modest amount of looks and talent and more than a modicum of serendipity,\" he wrote, \"I've managed to stretch my 15 minutes of fame into more than half a century of good fortune.\"", "summary": "\nWith his suave good looks and impeccable dress sense Robert Vaughn was an elegant presence in film and television for more than 50 years.\n\n"}

and in the 40 years since I grew up, traffic has increased hugely, and that's the main reason why none of us let our kids out on their own,\" Mr Moss told BBC News.\n\"The only solution would be to have pedestrian priority on every residential street in Britain; when you are driving along the street, if there are children playing, they have priority.\"\nThe report advocates having teachers take children for lessons outdoors when possible, with urban schools using parks.\nIt also says that authorities who cite \"health and safety\" as a reason for stopping children playing conkers or climbing trees should be aware that successive Health and Safety Executive heads have advocated a measure of risk-taking in children's lives.\nThe changes in childhood in previous decades are now filtering through into adulthood, where levels of obesity are also rising.\nDr Pencheon observed that although doctors are beginning to prescribe exercise instead of drugs where it is indicated, much more could be done from a policy perspective.\n\"One of the problems here is that the NHS is not incentivised financially to do public health,\" he said.\n\"The healthcare system is run on a rescue basis - people come to us when they're ill, we patch them up and try to get them going again - that's not the culture of a system designed to keep people healthy.\"\nThe National Trust is now beginning a two-month consultation aimed at gathering views and examples of good and bad practice from the public and specialists.\nThese will eventually be turned into a set of policy recommendations.\n\"As a nation, we need to do everything we can to make it easy and safe for our children to get outdoors,\" said National Trust director-general Fiona Reynolds.\n\"We want to move the debate on and encourage people and organisations to think about how we take practical steps to reconnect children with the natural world and inspire them to get outdoors.\"\nFollow Richardon Twitter", "summary": "\nUK children are losing contact with nature at a \"dramatic\" rate, and their health and education are suffering, a National Trust report says.\n\n"}

It said it was \"working to achieve compliance at the earliest possible date\".\nCookies are small files that allow a website to recognise and track users. The ICO groups them into three overlapping groups:\nSession cookies\nFiles that allow a site to link the actions of a visitor during a single browser session.

It might be used to study how people navigate a site.\nIt is classed as third-party if it is issued by a different server to that of the domain being visited. It could be used to trigger a banner advert based on the visitor's viewing habits.\nThe ICO insisted this weekend was not a deadline, but an attempt to help companies focus on their general cookie use.\n\"We never said was that if you're not compliant by 27 May we will come and get you,\" Mr Evans told the BBC.\n\"What we want is good compliance, not rushed compliance. If it's focused people's minds, that's a good thing.\"\nThe ICO has come under criticism from businesses for not being entirely clear about what constitutes compliance.\nVinod Bange, a data privacy specialist from law firm Taylor Wessing, said many businesses were nervous about implementing solutions.\n\"A lack of education and clear guidelines from the ICO on what constitutes compliance has left many businesses unsure of how to meet the directive with only one working day to go,\" he said.\n\"Few businesses want to be the first to adopt a specific approach. This is a risky game, as some organisations may be made an example of in order to set the parameters of compliancy moving forward.\"\nThis concern was shared by Tim Gurney, managing director of Wolf Software, a firm which helps websites become compliant.\nHe said the lack of clear guidance had led to some firms adopting systems which damaged the way visitors interacted with sites.\n\"Some of the implementations are very poor. For me, they're making a mistake because users will stop using their sites.\n\"Those kind of solutions I can see being changed as the user starts to say 'I don't like that'.\"\nMr Evans defended the ICO's approach, saying the ambiguity was to enable websites to interpret the rules to best suit their own audience and website design.\nHe also told the BBC that he believed that in the long term issues over cookie use should be regulated by the industry rather than government.\n\"What we want to do is look at where our resources can best be put,\" he said.\n\"If we were putting all our resources into investigating cookies, well, the people would quite rightly be asking where our priorities lie.\n\"Regulators have got resources that are not infinite.

Not through any fault of the Uruguayan.\nIf Rodgers was left with a \"what might have been\" it would come with the question of whether he should have picked Sturridge from the start\nSuarez was almost reduced to the role of pained observer in a first hour of overwhelming United superiority in which Van Persie demonstrated once more why the £24m handed over to Arsenal in the summer might just work out at the price on the ticket to their 20th title.\nVan Persie scored one magnificent goal, could have had another and then set up Nemanja Vidic's unwitting second, a glancing blow from Patrice Evra's header that proved fatal to Liverpool.\nSuarez, in sharp contrast, was starved of any supply worthy of the name and deserved better than to serve as little more than nuisance value until the introduction of Daniel Sturridge for the second half.\nWhereas Van Persie was offered constant support and supply as he looked like a master striker at the top of his game, Suarez was restricted to occasional flashes as he was left to trouble Rio Ferdinand and Vidic alone for 45 minutes.\nThe highly impressive Sturridge scored and was the catalyst for a marked Liverpool improvement that allowed manager Brendan Rodgers some optimism that looked well out of reach as his team were passive and negative as United established their lead.\nFerguson was left to reflect on another important victory that keeps United seven points clear of Manchester City. Despite suggesting his knowledge of the Premier League table is a little sketchy in some areas, Ferguson will remember City clawed back an eight-point deficit much later than this last season.\nRodgers, meanwhile, was threatening to stretch credibility just a little too far with his after-match observations.\nHe had every reason to be pleased with Liverpool's lively last half-hour but it must be placed in its proper context. The game had gone too far United's way before they woke up.\nFor a manager preaching courage to his players, Liverpool did little to supports Rodgers's message until they were two goals down.\nLiverpool may have impressed and even given United an anxious conclusion but the brutal fact remains that Rodgers has yet to oversee a Premier League victory against a team in the top half of the table this season.\nManchester United now have 55 points from 22 Premier League matches - this represents their highest tally at this stage of a top-flight season\nSource: Infostrada\nAnd the whole afternoon was a harrowing experience for Joe Allen - described rather generously by Rodgers on arrival as \"the Welsh Xavi\" - who looked out of his depth against Michael Carrick and Tom Cleverley. The £15m midfield man who followed Rodgers from Swansea was regarded as the shining symbol of what so many like to refer to as the Liverpool manager's \"philosophy\".\nAt Old Trafford his only serious contribution was to almost give two goals away while being run ragged, and it was a surprise he lasted 80 minutes before he was replaced by Jordan Henderson. And what a chastening 80 minutes they were for him.\nRodgers was bullish about Liverpool's future as he said: \"We are 24 points behind Manchester United but we are not 24 points behind in terms of quality.\n\"The difference is down to the squad. Once we close the gap in the squad I have great hope we will be able to challenge.\"\nThis is, however, a fairly significant difference and is a theory that carries the same flaw undermining Arsenal's continued \"jam tomorrow\" insistence that they will compete with the world's best in two years. This relies on the world's best standing still for two years waiting for Arsenal to catch up - and Rodgers should not expect Liverpool's Premier League rivals to hang around declining to improve their squads while he bolsters his. It will not be happening.\nSturridge was the big plus point and certainly gave Liverpool something to cling to as he suggested he could form a potent partnership with Suarez. This in itself leaves Rodgers with a dilemma - does he stick to his trademark 4-3-3 or will he utilise the pair in a 4-4-2 formation?\nIf Rodgers was left with a \"what might have been\" it would come with the question of whether he should have picked Sturridge from the start and why Liverpool were so timid until, ultimately, it was too late?\nOver the 90 minutes, and on chances created, Rodgers and Liverpool could not seriously complain about the outcome.\nLiverpool have had moments of promise against the likes of United, Manchester City, Chelsea and to a much lesser extent Arsenal this season without getting the win that would back up Rodgers's talk of progress.\nRodgers cannot be blamed for accentuating the positive but eventually Liverpool must take more than consolation from these matches. They will get another opportunity in their next two Premier League away games at Arsenal and Manchester City.\nUnited, meanwhile, can glow at what Van Persie has given them and press on in pursuit of another title.", "summary": "\nSir Alex Ferguson's pre-match jab in Liverpool's direction as he claimed he did not even know their Premier League position sounded more like a reflex action rather than a renewal of old rivalries.\n\n"}

Sexton converted superbly.\nOspreys prop Adam Jones, one of five from the Welsh region named in the Lions squad this week, was the next to be found wanting defensively.\nHis soft tackle at the base of a lineout out allowed Leinster scrum-half Luke McGrath to break clear, and Conway was perfectly placed on his shoulder to take an inside pass to race in for a second score.\nSexton's conversion completed a breathless opening for the rampant home side, but Ospreys were in no mood to relinquish their hold on the league title without a fight.\nBiggar took it upon himself to start the comeback, catching the home defence dozing with a quick tap penalty.\nThe fly-half had some way to go, but some more weak tackling, notably from McGrath, allowed him to wriggle his way over. He added the extras from the left touchline.\nA second try soon followed as Ospreys showed they had the handling skills and dynamic runners to match their host.\nA deflected clearance kick fell invitingly for Tom Habberfield and he promptly glided through the serrated defence into Leinster's 22.\nQuick ball was secured from the ruck and centre Ben John had too much power for Sexton in the right corner after Tom Bearman's well-timed pass.\nBut three minutes either side of half-time reasserted Leinster's dominance as they established a 12-point lead that they never looked like relinquishing.\nAfter Sexton's penalty with the final kick before the break, Conway gave the hosts the perfect start to the second half by completing his hat-trick.\nAgain, wing Ross Jones was caught out defensively as his opposite number collected his own kick ahead far too easily. Sexton's conversion from the right touchline went over off the left-hand post.\nA second Sexton penalty extended the lead, but again Ospreys showed a commendable appetite to fight back as they sensed their grip on the title slipping away.\nA marginal forward pass call denied Ashley Beck a try under the posts, but the centre's long pass then found Tom Isaacs in acres of space to cross over unopposed, with Biggar converting.\nBut any thoughts an unlikely late comeback were soon banished by Sexton's penalty and then replacement prop Healy produced a fitting finale to a enthralling contest by sprinting clear for the home side's fourth converted try.\nLeinster: R.

And many of the participants are carrying flowers to lay at the Freedom Monument, Latvia's symbol of national independence.\nThey have come here to commemorate those who died defending Latvia against the Soviet Union in the war.\nBut with Russian troops now in nearby Ukraine, many in the Baltics are alarmed that history may be about to repeat itself.\n\"If Ukraine falls, then Russian ambitions won't stop with this. I believe we will be next in Russia's list of actions,\" said one young man who had come to take part in the procession.\n\"It shows the attitude of Russia - how it goes into another country very easily and acts in an aggressive manner,\" said another.\nBut this annual memorial service is highly controversial. These elderly veterans fought against Russia - but for Nazi Germany.\nThe Baltics have spent much of their history being buffeted between neighbouring imperial forces.\nAnd in WWII, having already suffered severe oppression under Stalin, many Latvians saw Hitler's forces as the lesser of two evils - Latvia's only chance of not slipping back into Stalinist oppression.\nBut the veterans and their supporters are accused of being Nazi sympathisers - particularly by Latvia's large Russian-speaking community.\nAbout 1,000 Russian-speakers have gathered behind police barricades near the monument to protest. \"Fascists go home!\" shout some. \"Shame! Shame!\" shout others.\nThis year security is particularly tight, with as many police officers as participants, amid fears that the instability in Ukraine will spark ethnic tensions here.\nIt is a similar dynamic to Ukraine: pro-Moscow local Russian-speakers accusing pro-Western nationalists of being right-wing extremists. And like Ukraine, some Russian-speakers here say they are discriminated against by mainstream society.\n\"I feel like a person who is second-class,\" says Aleksandr Gaponenko, a Russian-speaker who moved to Soviet-era Latvia with his parents 59 years ago, when he was a one-year-old.\n\"We want equal rights for our languages, and we want equal social and economic rights.\"\nLatvia country profile\nAccording to the Latvian authorities, throughout the 20th Century people from elsewhere in the USSR were resettled in the Baltics as a deliberate Soviet policy to water down Baltic culture and destroy local national sentiment.\nAnd still today Russian-speakers are sometimes pejoratively called \"occupiers\".\nSo when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Mr Gaponenko, like many Russians, was not automatically granted Latvian citizenship, and lost his job in Riga city council.\nToday he is classed as a \"non-citizen\" - which means he is still not allowed to work for the state and does not have the right to vote.\nAround 300,000 Russian-speakers, or 13% of Latvia's population, are so-called \"non-citizens\". And they live in an EU member state and member of Nato.\nTo become Latvian, they have to prove their knowledge of the Latvian language and culture in a citizenship test - even if they were born here.\nSome Russian-speakers, such as Mr Gaponenko, refuse to take the test, saying that the country where they have spent all their lives should grant them citizenship automatically.\nOthers, particularly older people, say they do not speak Latvian well enough to pass the test.\nBut the Latvian government says it is encouraging all residents of Latvia to become citizens. And it accuses the Kremlin of using the issue to stir up resentment within the local Russian-speaking population and create political instability.\n\"There's massive propaganda, even an information warfare - not only here, and not only using Russian-speaking media, but also using other channels,\" says Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics.\nRussian-speakers often live very separate lives from their Latvian neighbours, living in different neighbourhoods, often socialising in different places.\nIn Riga city centre, one bar might be full of local Russian-speakers, next door packed with ethnic Latvians.\nEstimates of numbers of Russian-speakers vary. According to Latvian pollster SKDS, Russian-speakers make up 42% of the population in Latvia, with 58% described as ethnic Latvian.\nThis split in society is exacerbated by the political system.\nThe parties popular with ethnic Latvian voters manage to form convoluted governing coalitions to stay in power. Meanwhile Harmony Centre, a party voted for mainly by Russians-speakers, is stuck in opposition - despite having won more votes than any other single party in the last parliamentary elections of 2011.\nMost problematic, says political analyst and pollster Arnis Kaktins, is that Russian-speakers often consume all their news from media produced in Moscow, while ethnic Latvians tend to get their information from Latvian or Western news outlets.\nSo the two communities are developing opposing views about who is to blame for the crisis in Ukraine.\n\"When so many people rely heavily on Russian news sources, it means that Russia has an instrument to change their minds if it would like to,\" says Mr Kaktins.\nThere is a fear that the Kremlin could encourage Latvia's predominantly Russian-speaking border regions to follow Crimea's example and break away from Latvia to join Russia.\nAll three Baltic States are in Nato, so it is seen as unlikely that the Kremlin would send in troops, and start a conflict that the West would feel obliged to respond to militarily.\nThe real worry is that the crisis could increase divisions within Latvian society.\nSince independence in 1991, Latvia's two communities have lived side-by-side peacefully.\nBut if the conflict in Ukraine gets worse, the rift could grow between Russian-speakers who support Russia's President Vladimir Putin, and ethnic Latvians who support the West.", "summary": "\nA mournful procession of about 1,500 Latvians winds its way through Riga's medieval Old Town singing traditional Latvian songs.\n\n"}

A couple of weeks later, David phoned me.\"\nAfter being used to plush all-seater stadiums in his native South Africa, the 30-year-old Bloemfontein native admits the drive to the then ramshackle Ravenhill on day one was something of an eye-opener.\n\"Arriving here wasn't what I expected. My wife [Monique] was in the car with me and I thought, 'It's a bit different from what I'm used to'.\"\nFour years on, the club's facilities have had a complete makeover and there appears not even a hint of regret about his decision to spend his best rugby years in Belfast.\n\"It has been the right decision. Staying here has been really enjoyable,\" adds Pienaar, whose daughter Lemay was born in the city two years ago.\nA committed Christian, he regularly gives talks on his faith to church groups with other members of the Ulster squad and has previously spoken of his belief that he has found himself in Belfast for \"reasons that are not entirely to do with rugby\".\nNot even a reportedly lucrative offer from French outfit Toulon last autumn could tempt Pienaar away from his adopted home, although the South African suggests that the reports may have been a \"little exaggerated\".\n\"I've never heard about the 60,000 Euro (£50,000) a month,\" he says of the suggested salary on offer in France. \"I guess that's just a bit of a rumour because I don't think that's true.\"\nThis year's Six Nations had some memorable rugby but it is doubtful it served up anything to match the individual brilliance produced by Pienaar in Ulster's Heineken Cup win over Leicester in January.\nThe South African scored all of Ulster's points in a 22-19 victory, a result that maintained the Irish province's 100% pool record and set up Saturday's home quarter-final.\nGranted, Ulster's pack delivered the platform for Pienaar, but his performance of composed orchestration was something to behold.\n\"I was sitting in the changing room after the game with Gilly [Ulster wing Craig Gilroy] and he just said to me, 'Isn't it unfair how good Ruan is?'\" says Andrew Trimble, another Ulster team-mate. \"A massive amount of our game plan revolves around him.\"\nIt is much easier to get Pienaar's Ulster colleagues and analysts to talk about his ability than to elicit thoughts from the man himself on his talent.\nBBC Sport Northern Ireland pundit Maurice Field believe Pienaar's greatest attribute is to \"create time for himself and his team-mates\".\n\"He's a completely different type of scrum-half to abrasive ones like Danny Care and Conor Murray who always seem to be playing at 100 miles an hour,\" says the former Ireland centre.\nFor his own part, the understated South African invariably smiles his way through interviews without betraying the merest hint of arrogance.\nBut he is relaxed talking about his \"rugby upbringing\" with his father Gysie having earned 13 Springboks caps in the early 1980s. \"I was born and my Dad straight away had a rugby ball in my arms,\" he says.\n\"My father actually played against Ireland in 1981 and our Ulster team doctor, David Irwin - who played for Ireland in that series - showed me a picture from a newspaper article where he was actually next to my Dad.\n\"The Springboks had a fantastic team then and if there had been a World Cup in that era, I think they would have come close to winning it. They had the likes of Naas Botha, Danie Gerber, Ray Mordt.\"\nIn Pienaar's teenage years, his father was backs coach for Currie Cup side Free State Cheetahs and the young Ruan would invariably watch the players being put through their paces in training after school.\nYet while he had followed his father's example, Pienaar acknowledges that being sent to the famous Grey College also played a major part in his rugby development.\nThe Bloemfontein school is renowned for its sporting emphasis, having helped produce dozens of Springboks internationals, including Morne du Plessis, Ruben Kruger and Francois Steyn, in addition to other sports stars such as cricketer Hansie Cronje and athlete LJ van Zyl.\n\"Bismarck du Plessis [Springbok hooker] was the same year as me,\" Pienaar recalls. \"Francois Steyn was a couple of years younger and there were others like CJ van der Linde [Springbok prop] were there around the same time as me.\"\nHis development at Grey College soon caught the eyes of the South African selectors and he played in the Springboks sides which earned under-19 and under-21 world championship triumphs.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThen, in 2007, the 22-year-old Pienaar helped his country achieve the ultimate prize as he was part of the World Cup-winning squad in France.\n\"I had to contest [for scrum-half] with Fourie du Preez and I started only once against Tonga,\" he says. \"I was full-back that day and for the rest of the tournament was on the bench. But to be part of the 30 players going to a World Cup and lifting the trophy at the end of the tournament was unbelievable.\"\nOver the next three years, consistently impressive displays for the Natal Sharks helped Pienaar bring up his caps haul to 43 before he finally followed through on his urge to play rugby \"somewhere in Europe\".\nPienaar took the decision to sign for Ulster even though the South African rugby authorities had not yet resolved to remove the bar on foreign-based players from representing the Springboks.\nAs it transpired, the ruling was eventually dispensed with and Pienaar has played 31 times for his country in the last four years as he produced the best form of his career.\nIt may not have been just Ulster supporters who had their hearts in their mouths when Pienaar finished the recent Pro12 win over Scarlets clutching a shoulder but the soundings from the coaching staff in recent days suggest that their inspirational scrum-half will be fit to play in Saturday's crunch European game.\nWhatever happens this weekend, Ulster fans can look forward to seeing Pienaar in action at Ravenhill until at least the summer of 2017.\n\"I'm happy with the decision I've made to stay here for another couple of years,\" he says. \"Playing for Ulster has been really fantastic.\n\"The support I've been given over here has been phenomenal.

{"id": "26849311", "document": "The images are often distressing and stick in the mind, yet the conflict in Rwanda from 20 years ago is arguably one that saw some of the most heart-wrenching pictures I have seen. Plus, some that are beyond description.\nBetween April and June 1994, in the space of 100 days, extremist Hutus slaughtered some 800,000 people, mostly ethnic Tutsis but also some moderate Hutus. You can read the background to that in other stories on this site, but I wanted to mark the moment here.\nThere are times when a photograph can raise awareness of an event and perhaps act as a catalyst for action, and at other times they can seem to be little more than an intrusion into times of sorrow.  Sometimes, even when the event depicted is one of total horror, the world fails to react in a way that perhaps we'd hope it might. Of course there might be complex and diverse reasons for that.\nBut there are also pictures that do so much more, and a set of photographs unearthed in the offices of Save the Children in Kigali, Rwanda, did just that. They are not well-crafted pictures by professionals, but Polaroid snaps that do what photography does best by providing a facsimile of the real world. These pictures changed lives, and gave some hope for their future.\nFollowing the genocide in 1994, Save the Children worked to document children across the country who had been orphaned or separated from their families. The goal was to reunite children with surviving family members or to place them with families who could raise them.\nThe archive found in Rwanda in 2013 contained thousands of Polaroid photos and hand-written files and inspired a team to try to find some of these children as adults and ask them about their memories of that time.\nAfter witnessing his parents being killed in the first days of the genocide in the village of Jali, Flodouard collected his younger siblings, Cyprien and Gloriose, and fled.\nFlodouard said: \"We survived the massacres by the grace of God, because on our own we would never have been capable.\n\"This was on 11 April 1994. That is the date our parents were killed here in Nyamitanga [a small village in Jali where they lived]. When the massacres were happening, I was there but I hid myself underneath the corpses. It was as if God himself was hiding me, but I saw everything that happened.\n\"There were dead bodies on top of me, but I was able to get up and run away all the way until I reached the military barracks. There were many of us who fled to the barracks, I remember there was a heavy rain falling, we were taken in there by the soldiers, by the government soldiers. At nine in the morning, the interahamwe [Hutu militia] came there to kill us. When they came, it was at this very moment that the rebel soldiers of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front, Tutsis] arrived.\n\"We spent a week in Karuruma. After several weeks the soldiers of the RPF told us we should flee because the battles were getting more dangerous. Bombs started falling on top of us at Karuruma so we took to the road and headed towards Byumba. When we made it as far as the sugar factory, the RPF soldiers told us to rest and that they would arrange for us to be transported in vehicles. So we spent the night there. During the night, they brought vehicles and they took us to Byumba. I remember we arrived there very late at night I was with my siblings this entire time. I was with my three younger siblings. The youngest one was only two years old. But because I didn't know how to take care of a little child, she died when we arrived at Byumba. That's where she is buried.\n\"I can't say that I had any strength. It's God who did everything. At that time, when you found someone from your family who had survivedâ€¦ I can't explain where that strength came from. It was just there.\n\"You see it was during such a difficult time. We had already gone four days without eating. At the time, we were hungry and we were in mourning, but when you see someone from your family, whether it's a child or an adult - the strength to take that person and flee with them just comes to you. We didn't even think about our hunger, we only thought about saving the lives of our family.\"\nAfter documenting and tracing the children's known relatives, Save the Children reunited the siblings with a paternal uncle and returned them to their home village of Jali. When Flodouard turned 18, he did a small job until he saved up enough money to establish a farm on his parents' land.\nAt this point, he gave up on the opportunity to pursue an education or professional career in order to build a house back in the village in the Rutongo district where the family are from and raise his younger siblings in a home where they could live together as a family. Flodouard is now a small farmer and the father of three children of his own.\nCyprien currently lives in Gisenyi, where he works as a mechanic in the Rwanda military.\nGloriose is currently studying crop science at the University of Rwanda's College of Agriculture, Animal Sciences, and Veterinary Medicine in Busogo. Her dream is to complete a masters degree and have a career that will allow her to take care of her older brothers and pay the school fees for her nieces and nephews.\nEvans was eight years old when he and his brother Jean-Baptiste, then 15, had to leave their village during the genocide.\nEvans said: \"When I look at this picture of myself from this time, I see a child who was suffering a lot. The child in this photo didn't know what had happened to his family. And after this photo was taken, I suffered even more when I realised that my parents were gone. Little by little, my wounds healed, but my suffering is still with me.\n\"When I saw this photo of myself I was surprised. I can't believe that Save the Children would still remember me and come to see me. I also can't believe a photograph of me as a child even exists.\n\"I've never had a photo of myself as a youth. But especially to see that Save the Children has come back to visit me all these years later - it's very moving for me.\n\"Given that I lived through such a difficult time in my life, seeing this photo reminds me of how far I have come since then. It makes me think about the path I've taken to get where I am today. There was a time in my life where I didn't know if I would live one day to the next, where I felt like I wasn't going to survive - but here I am. Seeing this photo brings back the long journey I've made from then until now.\"\nJean-Baptiste said:  \"I lost my family as a child and I had a difficult life. But now that I am a father and I am raising my own children, I understand the importance of family. A family is a child's main source of protection. I am able to provide for my children and make sure that they have enough to eat and don't have to search for food on their own. I protect my children so that they do not suffer through what I suffered, so that they never have to be the victims of violence or exploitation.\n\"When a child has a family, they have protectors who look after them, who feed them - who protect them from harm. My hope for my children is that they are able to go to school and get an education, that they live in a peaceful country, that they are able to grow up and have jobs and live happily.\n\"Myself, I lost so many things in my life. I wasn't able to finish my education because I had no family to support me. Now I am doing everything I can to make sure my children have the good things that I wasn't able to have.\"\nAnd finally, a small selection of Polaroid photographs that capture the moment of reunification between separated children and their families.", "summary": "\nThroughout my years at the BBC I have watched photographs arrive on the news wires from all parts of the globe, many depicting the latest conflict, natural disaster or refugee crisis.\n\n"}

It is arguably not rational to choose your insurance based on an anthropomorphised meerkat or your toilet roll because you like puppies.\nBut emotional advertising works. Cuddly creatures turn cute into cash.\nBaby animals have the edge - fubsy lion cubs are cute - but their adult counterparts are, no matter how handsome, menacing.\nThere is an obvious evolutionary explanation as to why we are drawn to human young - they need looking after or our species will die out.\nBut why do we have the feeling towards most baby mammals?\nNobel prize-winning Austrian academic Konrad Lorenz (1903-1989), who studied the evolutionary and adaptive significance of human behaviours - human ethology - pointed out many animals, for reasons entirely unrelated to enticing humans to be their caregivers, possess some features also shared by human babies but not adults: Large eyes, snub nose, bulging forehead and retreating chin.\nLorenz believed we are tricked by an evolved response to human young and we transfer our reaction to the same set of features in other mammals.\nAnthropologist Andrew Marlow argues this reaction boils down to the way we, as humans, develop.\nHe suggests the bar for triggering the nurturing impulse is very low in humans, because human babies are ill-equipped to survive and need an enormous amount of looking after.\n\"It is partly an evolutionary battle between the pelvis and the cranium,\" said Dr Marlow.\n\"We are the only animal which walks exclusively on two legs. It freed our arms for using tools, weapons and gathering food. But the trade-off is that to accommodate our bipedalism, pelvises shifted position and became narrower.\n\"A modern woman is not physically capable of giving birth to anything larger than the head of a baby.\n\"Therefore the human brain has to develop a lot after birth, rather than in utero.\n\"Human babies are very vulnerable.\"\nLorenz pointed out we judge the appearance of other animals by the same criteria as we judge our own - although the judgment may be utterly inappropriate in an evolutionary context.\nFor example, new born chicks - despite appearances - are probably not yearning for a cuddle; and camels, with their noses in the air, are possibly not actually haughty.\nEven aquatic creatures provoke the response - many of us see a dolphin, with its bulbous forehead and smiley face, as \"cute\". Conversely, a shark, which is not a mammal, seems to have a cruel mouth and mean eyes.\nNothing is inherently attractive or ugly, argues evolutionary biologist Simone Fellowes.\n\"It is our response which interprets it so. If babies began being born with long noses and narrow heads, or even horns, we would start to find those features appealing.\n\"In a more distilled way, it is why parents tend to believe their own offspring are more attractive than other babies.\n\"There is an inherent instinct to preserve our own lineage. With a narrow focus, it means our own specific DNA. A wider focus means all human young. An even wider focus means all mammalian young.\"\nIt means that although we are unlikely to confuse an infant human with a seal pup, we still have an impulse to care for the little fluffy creature with its big, imploring, black eyes.\nThis desire can even go as far as inanimate objects.\nCars marketed as \"cute\", such as the VW Beetle or Mini Cooper, have rounded bodies, prominent headlights and a short front end - or a chubby tummy, big eyes and a snub nose.\n\"This is deliberate,\" said designer Ben Crowther. \"Especially in a quickly-growing market of female buyers, friendly [looking] cars are increasingly popular.\n\"It follows on that a significant proportion of these cars are given nicknames, further anthropomorphising them, bringing affections, and therefore loyalty.\"\nWith their tough grey skin, beady eyes, flappy ears and visually ridiculous noses, elephant calves should not appeal - but they do.\nAgain, it could be ascribed to identifying with human babies, said Mrs Fellowes.\nElephant calves, although not similar in looks to human young, have the elements of other behaviours - they look clumsy, playful, fragile (next to their craggy relatives) and innocent.\nThey stay close to their mothers, a survival instinct, but we interpret it as love.\n\"We see infantile behaviour, interpret it incorrectly, and transfer our affections,\" said Mrs Fellowes.\nSo when we find something adorably cute and aww over an elephant, or coo over a cub - we are not rationally responding to something which needs looking after; we could actually be compensating for a narrow birth canal and a poorly-developed brain.\nWhich, in terms of human survival, is a very cute trick indeed.", "summary": "\nA newborn elephant at West Midlands Safari Park recently pressed a \"cute button\" across the world when its picture was shared on social media around the world.

{"id": "28205291", "document": "The offer was made in a letter from regions chairmen Peter Thomas (Blues), Martyn Hazell (Dragons), Roger Blyth (Ospreys) and Nigel Short (Scarlets).\nIn extreme circumstances the regions may even be forced to offload players.\nThey stated if a deal is not done: \"We will have to scale back on our playing costs and development.\"\nIt is unlikely that the WRU would accept the offer to take control of the game's professional tier because of the financial state of the regions.\nIn the letter the chairmen stated: \"Together we can be strong, but in the disharmony that currently prevails, we will ultimately all be weak.\n\"We cannot continue in this fashion any longer.\n\"The alternative, which we have tabled before, but which you have always rejected, is that you [the WRU] makes a fair offer to take over the regions if you believe you could make a better job of running the same, although this is something you have refused to countenance previously.\n\"If it is of attraction, then it would need to be concluded rapidly.\"\nShort, Thomas, Blyth and Hazell added: \"There will be clear consequences for the WRU in respect of the retention of Welsh players, with regard to release periods and additional international fixtures.\n\"For the regions we will have to scale back on our playing costs and development accordingly with the financial consequences that will have for us.\n\"Unfortunately that is the harsh reality of the situation we find ourselves in and the outcome of the existing relationship we feel we have with the WRU.\"\nThe last participation agreement between the WRU and Regional Rugby Wales (RRW) ended on 30 June, leaving the regions believing they face a combined £6.7m shortfall next season.\nThat contract guaranteed the release of players for Wales coach Warren Gatland's two-week squad training camps ahead of November games, the Six Nations and for the fourth autumn Test which Wales regularly stage outside the approved International Rugby Board window.\nIf a new deal is not finalised the regions could ensure Wales face South Africa on 29 November without any regional players.\nThe regions would also withhold players from Wales Sevens duty.\nIn the letter to WRU chief executive Lewis and chairman Pickering, Thomas, Blyth, Short and Hazell said: \"We have been negotiating with the WRU for a considerable period.\nAt every point when we think we have made progress and reached a commercial outcome, we are subsequently frustrated by the constant shifts and manipulation in the WRU position\n\"But we have come to the conclusion that... the harsh reality is that the WRU has no interest in concluding negotiations with the regions and entering into a long-term agreement for the betterment of Welsh rugby.\"\nThe quartet go on to say:\n•Despite some reservations they have accepted - for the first time - the concept of dual national contracts for the nation's Test stars.\n•On the subject of the regions' funding, that a failure to strike a deal would mean them having to live within their means and become less competitive against Pro12 and European rivals.\n•The relationship between the WRU and \"its principal clubs\" is a \"national disgrace\" and has left Welsh rugby \"not held in high esteem\".\n•That \"the true objective of the WRU is actually to starve the regions to the point of financial ruin\".\n•The WRU and regions' goals \"are not incompatible\"\n•Any agreement must mean a partnership, not an \"employer/employee or master/slave\" relationship.\n•For developing players for Wales the regions should be \"adequately rewarded\".\nThe chairmen went on: \"At every point when we think we have made progress and reached a commercial outcome, we are subsequently frustrated by the constant shifts and manipulation in the WRU position.\n\"This has been amply demonstrated on any number of occasions.\"\nIn the letter, the four chairmen go on to claim they have been left with no option but to suggest their current course of action.\n\"This is not meant as a threat nor is it a decision that has been taken lightly, but rather as a position in respect of which we have no alternative,\" they stated.\n\"That will have severe and dramatic consequences for all of us and in respect of which there will be no going back.\"\nThe row between the Union and regions has been running for over a year and a half.\nPickering outlined the WRU's position during the impasse when he said in May: \"We will do whatever we can to support our regions, but we cannot bankrupt the Union.\n\"There will be a defined amount of money we have to give to our game at regional level, semi-pro level and the community game.\"\nThe board of the WRU overwhelmingly survived a vote of no confidence at an extraordinary general meeting on 15 June.\nAt that meeting board member Gerald Davies said the Union was \"not held in high regard, it is held in low esteem overseas... it is distressing we have this reputation… we need to restore common purpose, trust and unity\".\nThe former Wales and British and Irish Lions wing has since announced he will not be standing for re-election to board.\nDuring the protracted row, teams from around Europe negotiated a revamp of cross-border competitions that will succeed the Heineken Cup next season.\nThe regions, represented by RRW, were party to that deal and are represented on the board of the new company set up to run the three-tier tournament from Switzerland.\nHowever, none of the funding from that tournament is scheduled to be in the regions' hands until October, 2014.\nThe regions have been partly funded via the WRU in an agreement which guaranteed a set level of income and covered the release of players for Wales international duties.\nOther funding came via participation in competitions.\nThe regions contended the previous agreement did not give them enough money to compete against leading French and English teams.\nA number of high-profile Wales international players have already made big-money moves to play in France or England, with the Welsh regions claiming to be unable to match the wages on offer elsewhere.\nBritish and Irish Lions Leigh Halfpenny (Blues to Toulon), Richard Hibbard (Ospreys to Gloucester) and Jonathan Davies (Scarlets to Clermont Auvergne) are among the players to have left Wales.\nNone of the Welsh teams reached the knockout stages of the European Cup or the play-offs of the Pro12 in 2013-14.\nRegional Rugby Wales issued a statement saying they: \"Must now urgently consider the stark practical consequences of operating within a business model that does not include any form of agreement with the WRU outside IRB regulations and no WRU support or involvement in the development of professional regional rugby.\"\nThe WRU responded: \"The WRU is confident that the governing body and RRW are in substantial agreement on the total monies contributed by the WRU within the RSA (Rugby Services Agreement) and the governing body will work to ensure the rugby commitments associated to the payments are acceptable to all parties and in the best interests of Welsh rugby.\"", "summary": "\nWales' four regions have offered the Welsh Rugby Union the chance to take them over and want a deal to end their impasse by 18 July.\n\n"}

Particularly if head teachers are frightened, if school leaders are frightened, if teachers are frightened to speak out because of fear for their jobs, fear they won't be promoted.\"\nSir Michael said he had spoken to parents in Birmingham and had been \"hugely impressed\" by them.\n\"We need to get this sorted as soon as possible,\" he said.", "summary": "\nInspectors found pupils at the so-called Trojan Horse schools in Birmingham were \"vulnerable to extremism\", says Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw.\n\n"}

That was hard but I think you learn to deal with it.\"\nIn an exclusive interview, the 2012 BBC Sports Personality of the Year, who competes for England in the team pursuit in Glasgow, also revealed that:\nJust 10 days after becoming the first British rider to win the Tour de France, Wiggins won his fourth Olympic gold medal, and a then British record seventh medal in all, in the time trial in London.\n\"You can plan physically to try to win the Tour but I could never plan for what was going to happen after it,\" he recalled.\n\"It just went mad for a bit.

Making the move was made easier by two things - first the internet, which allows him to continue to function as a journalist; and second the dearth of openings for independent journalists these days in Moscow.\n\"There is really nowhere for me to write, no place where I would even fantasise about working,\" he told liberal magazine Afisha.\nEmigre journalists like Oleg Kashin and Leonid Bershidsky have come under fire from some colleagues.

He married former model Leticia Webber, 34, last year and in June she had twins, adding to the daughter Mr Neves has from a previous marriage.\nHis supporters say he is ready to take on the challenge of leading the world's seventh largest economy.\nThey point to his remarkable performance from 2003 to 2010 as governor of the state of Minas Gerais - an economic powerhouse and, as it is very populous, of key importance in the election.\nDuring his seven years as governor, he cut state expenditure, boosted tax revenues, improved the level of education and health and turned Minas Gerais into one of the most business-friendly states in the country.\nAnd yet he failed to beat Ms Rousseff in Minas Gerais, where he received less than 40% of the votes, against slightly more than 43% for the incumbent.\nAecio, as he is known among Brazilians who like to call their presidents by their first names, presents himself as the right candidate to take over an economy in which growth - once at 7.5% a year - has stalled.\nBut the 54-year-old economist's fondness for such terms as \"management shock\" and \"efficiencies\" may not go down well with Brazilians who have benefitted from the current government's income-redistribution policies.\nMr Neves has yet to explain how he would tackle inflation and streamline public finances without hurting public services or laying off public sector workers.\nMs Rousseff has warned that a vote for Mr Neves could \"revive ghosts of the past\", referring to his party's time in power between 1995 and 2003, when then President Fernando Henrique Cardoso ended rampant inflation at the expense of industry, jobs and economic growth.\nThe two candidates are poised to clash bitterly over their views on the handling of Petrobras, Brazil's state oil giant and arguably the country's main economic asset.\nThe company's corporate finances have been hit and Petrobras has had to buy expensive petrol abroad only to sell it at lower prices on the domestic market to avoid fuelling inflation.\nTo make matters worse the company is investigating an alleged bribery scheme reportedly linked to top politicians, some of them members of the governing Workers' Party and groups which back President Rousseff.\nMs Rousseff and her Workers' Party in turn are likely to point to corruption scandals during the time Mr Neves's party was in power in the 1990s.\nMr Neves himself has had corruption allegations levelled against him over the building of an airport in his home state during his tenure as governor.\nHe has denied the allegations, saying that the airport was built following a proper tender process that had been investigated and cleared by a state audit body.\nMr Neves is currently riding on a wave of sentiment against the Workers' Party generated by a mix of political fatigue following its 12 years in power and a perception that the governing party has mismanaged the economy and been tainted by too many corruption scandals.\nBut if he is to narrow Ms Rousseff's eight-percentage-point lead, Mr Neves will have to persuade voters that does not just stand for change - but for change in the right direction.", "summary": "\nOn Sunday, Senator Aecio Neves of the centre-right Brazilian Social Democracy Party surprised pollsters when he sailed into the second round of the Brazilian elections, beating environmentalist Marina Silva into third place by a comfortable margin.\n\n"}

{"id": "29624259", "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nBritish journalist Nick Ames was inside Belgrade's Partizan Stadium for the Euro 2016 qualifier between Serbia and Albania on Tuesday. Here is his eye-witness account of what happened as the match was abandoned amid chaotic scenes…\nIt was tempting to think Serbia's Euro 2016 qualifier against Albania - the latter's first visit to Belgrade since 1967 - was going to conclude without incident.\nSerbia had dominated a slow-paced game and looked favourites to win at 0-0.\nThere had been little yet to rile a crowd that was bereft of away supporters after Uefa had stepped into a dispute over the terms under which travelling fans could attend the game.\nThat would change with the passing of a few confusing seconds that still require some untangling.\nMartin Atkinson, an English Premier League referee, had already stopped play once when a flare thrown from the stands disrupted an Albanian corner.\nHe had to do so again shortly after the 40-minute mark when another firework only narrowly missed its white-shirted target.\nBut there was something else afoot - a fact Serbia's players, Danko Lazovic chief among them, were straining to tell Atkinson as he supervised the extinguishing of the flare.\nWhat few had noticed was that hovering over the Serbian half with a mixture of menace and filmic quirkiness was a small remote-controlled drone. More easily noticeable, once attentions had been caught, was the flag suspended from it that was being lowered slowly on to the pitch.\nThe flag bore the Albanian black-eagle insignia, a map of a notional 'Greater Albania' and the faces of Ismail Qemali and Isa Boletini, two important figures in the era that centred around the country's independence in 1912.\nThe politics relevant to the game can accurately be explained by Kosovo - a largely ethnically-Albanian territory that unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in 2008.\nA war was fought over Kosovo in the late 1990s, when the territory's ethnic Albanian insurgents battled with the Serbian military and police. Some Albanians see it as a natural part of the 'Greater Albania' that would include all areas of ethnic Albanian population. Kosovo has been recognised by the United States and major European Union countries but not by Serbia.\nAs soon as the flag was caught by Serbia's Stefan Mitrovic, events spiralled out of control.\nThe defender was confronted by two Albanian players, Andi Lila and Taulant Xhaka, who attempted to retrieve their flag - it was eventually recovered by their team-mate Bekim Balaj who ran with it towards the edge of the pitch.\nBut what had happened in the meantime was the death knell for this Balkan derby: a number of fans - including the unmistakeable figure of Ivan Bogdanov, a notorious Serbian ultra who served time in jail after hooligans caused a Euro 2012 qualifier in Italy to be abandoned in 2010 - penetrated the ring of police around the pitch.\nMatters escalated quickly as members of staff from each side also piled in.\nOne supporter attacked Balaj with a plastic chair before he was wrestled to the ground by Albania captain and former Sunderland player Lorik Cana.\nScuffles were breaking out everywhere, hands raised and blows being struck, and the pattern only ceased when the visiting players opted to run for the tunnel - situated below were some of Serbia's more vociferous ultras were positioned.\nThe Albanians scurried inside, pelted by missiles from the crowd, while another supporter broke through and aimed a head-high kick at one player.\nIn the press box, we received the unlikely news that the match might resume, but another 15 minutes or so later the game was abandoned.\nWithin an hour, there was little hint of the astonishing scenes that had just passed.\nThere were, of course, no obvious visiting fans. The identity of the drone's controller is still unclear despite a couple of early mis-steps in the local media - it is thought to have been operated inside the stadium - and other equally pressing questions remain.\nThe stadium's security, criticised heavily by Cana after the game, appears to have plenty to answer for given the ease with which supporters entered the pitch and the drone was brought in.\nSerbia will fear a heavy punishment after this latest in a string of controversies, which has included Partizan Belgrade fans displaying an anti-Semitic banner in last month's Europa League match against Tottenham Hotspur.\nThey can point to provocation, although their own fans were far from angelic in much of their chanting towards the Albanians.\nA Uefa investigation into the events is already under way.", "summary": "\nPartizan Stadium was quiet, perhaps too quiet, as half-time approached.\n\n"}

{"id": "30131446", "document": "Millions of payment card details have been liberated by gangs that targeted the payment systems at tills.\nThe attacks started in December 2013 with US retailer Target. Throughout 2014 other stores, including Home Depot, Staples, Sears, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom to name but a few, all fell victim to the till-tapping gangs.\nAs well as liberating tens of millions of credit card numbers, the attacks cost some senior executives their jobs and left those that were hit with a bill that often ran into the tens of millions of dollars to clean up. Home Depot said the bill for clearing up after its breach would hit $43m (Â£28m).\nThere were so many attacks that the FBI issued a three-page confidential warning to American retailers telling them to watch out for malicious programs aimed at them.\nThe key word in that last sentence is \"American\". Almost all the big thefts of customer data were from large US stores.\n\"There's a fundamental flaw in the US credit card system in that they do not use chip and pin,\" said Seth Berman, managing director of the London office of risk management firm Stroz Friedburg.\n\"The US is doing everyone a favour by acting as a honeypot for criminals, and in addition the country has more credit cards per head than anywhere else,\" he said.\nThe popularity of attacking retailers was revealed by security firm Lancope which spotted 10 separate families of malware that targets retailers. The malicious programs come in different shades of sophistication. Some keep an eye on the underlying processes that a cash till is cycling through as it totals up your bill and only grabs data when it knows the payment info is being processed.\nSome programs, said Lancope, have been so successful that they are now offered as services with tech support available for those hi-tech criminals just getting started in the cyber theft game.\nAnalysis of the breaches at the US retailers shows the thieves targeted the systems that pass card data around the internal computer networks of large stores. In some cases, the malware used to pilfer card numbers, names and other details scraped the memory of card-reading devices on tills to capture the information before it is processed and any encryption was applied.\nRichard Goodall from retail IT specialist PCMS said relatively few US stores have adopted card processing standards, known as PCI DSS, that are designed to ensure organisations do a good job of securing payment information and make \"in-flight\" data capture harder to carry out.\n\"PCI DSS defines where the data is held and how it moves through the system,\" he said, adding that it tells card handlers to separate key data fields to make it harder for thieves to piece together who used which card when, and what they bought.\nBy contrast, European firms have been enthusiastic adopters of PCI DSS and this, alongside work to upgrade systems for chip and pin, had helped make them less of a target, he said.\nBut if older tech proved a weak point for US retailers, then newer tech might help them do a better job of securing tills and pay points in stores.\nThe newer tech is called Near Field Communication (NFC) and lets people pay just by touching a card or a smartphone to a reading device.\nHoward Berg, a spokesman for European payments technology firm Gemalto, said NFC was designed to speed up payments and help to cut down the need to carry cash to make those low value purchases. At the moment. in Europe, NFC transactions are limited to a Â£20 maximum - far higher than the average amount people spend when using cash.\n\"When you do a contactless NFC transaction you are not going to get the details you need for fraud,\" said Mr Berg. \"You do not get the card holder name or the CVV code.\"\nMany people used a NFC-enabled card to carry out those the pay-by-touching transactions, he said, but this would likely change as more and more smartphones were released and bought that have an NFC chip onboard.\nMany of these chips were not yet activated, said Mr Berg, but the latent population of NFC-capable phones was growing steadily. In addition, he said, payment card firms and others were now moving to use NFC systems so consumers can use their phone to pay.\nUsing NFC by phone and combining it with any form of tokenisation to generate a one-time \"token\" rather than exposing the real card number adds another layer of obscurity that thieves have to hack through, he said.\n\"It's not handing over the card number,\" said Mr Berg, \"it's a unique one-off token that changes for each transaction.\"\nAnyone grabbing that token would only get information about a single purchase, said Mr Berg, and would not be able to re-use it to buy other stuff.\nHe cautioned against thinking that NFC was going to eliminate fraud but said it did put tighter limits on how a thief might go about doing it.\n\"We don't think we will see breaches happen at the point of sale because there's not that much information travelling at that point,\" he said.\nPerhaps the only upside to the rash of security breaches at large US retailers is that it has made them intimately familiar with the best, and worst, way to tell customers that their data has gone astray.

{"id": "30383761", "document": "For years the Pakistani military has been accused by the Afghans, the Americans and Nato of playing a double game - helping the Nato-US coalition in Afghanistan on the one hand, but at the same time allowing al-Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban to seek refuge and garner logistical support in Pakistan.\nEven the killing of Osama Bin Laden by US special forces in Abbottabad, a military garrison town in Pakistan, did not push the military into changing its tune, which was always one of denial that it supported the Afghan Taliban. Many leaders of the Afghan Taliban have lived in Pakistan since 2001.\nThese accusations dogged Pakistan's new army chief General Raheel Sharif when he visited Washington for 10 days last month - particularly that in the past six months of a military offensive in North Waziristan the Pakistan army had failed to capture or kill a single prominent militant leader.\nBut now those assumptions may be changing and the complex three-way relationship between the US, Afghanistan and Pakistan could be on the cusp of undergoing a dramatic improvement.\nFor the first time in nearly 10 years the Pakistan army has killed a high-level leader of al-Qaeda. Adnan el Shukrijumah, a naturalised American citizen, was killed during a raid by Pakistani forces at a compound in the South Waziristan tribal agency close to the Afghan border on 6 December. He was accused of involvement in planning several failed attacks in the US and Britain nearly a decade ago and had been hiding in the tribal belt along the border ever since.\nThe following day, reports said a US drone had killed Umer Farooq, another top al-Qaeda leader in the North Waziristan tribal agency. A Pakistani national, he was allegedly al-Qaeda's operational commander in charge of Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nSuddenly both Pakistan and the US appear to be collaborating to root out al-Qaeda in a manner not seen since 2002-2004 when the Pakistan army killed or captured many al-Qaeda operatives.\nThe US has begun obliging Pakistan too. For the first time the US is targeting Pakistani Taliban insurgents who had earlier taken refuge in Afghanistan from where they carried out strikes into Pakistan.\nAccording to senior Afghan sources, they were clandestinely being supported by the government of former Afghan President Hamid Karzai in a tit-for-tat revenge game for Pakistan's support for the Afghan Taliban.\nThe US has now begun targeting those Pakistani Taliban for the first time and significantly the Afghan authorities are not objecting. A US drone strike on 7 December killed nine suspected Pakistani Taliban in Afghanistan's Kunar province. The dead included a senior Pakistani Taliban commander, police said\nAn earlier US drone strike had tried to target Mullah Fazlullah, the current head of the Pakistani Taliban, who is also thought to be living in Kunar province. Pakistan has been asking the US and the Afghans to carry out such attacks for more than a year, but only now - after gaining Pakistani co-operation on other fronts - is Washington obliging Islamabad.\nClearly, Washington is pleased the way the Pakistan army is reacting. Pakistan has been further rewarded by the US. On 7 December the US military confirmed that it had handed over three Pakistani Taliban, including Latif Mehsud to the Pakistani authorities. Latif Mehsud had been the second-in-command of the Pakistani Taliban under its previous leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, who was killed in a US drone strike last year.\nLatif Mehsud was seized by US forces in October 2013 in eastern Afghanistan as he tried to broker deals between the Afghan authorities and the Pakistani Taliban living on Afghan territory. The Pakistani authorities view him as a danger to the country and have been insisting on his prompt return. His sudden repatriation - again with no objections from Kabul - is a signal of improved relations.\nSo far, there is a change of direction and much greater co-operation on the ground in military terms between the US, Pakistan and Afghanistan. But will this bring about a real change in political attitudes?\nThe Afghan government will now be waiting to see how the Pakistani military obliges Kabul. The Afghans will also be looking to see if the Pakistanis use their clout to try to rein in Taliban attacks in Kabul. The most important thing Islamabad can do is to allow Afghan negotiators to meet the Afghan Taliban leaders who are living in Pakistan.\nThat could be the most significant move of all and start the long process of ending the war in Afghanistan.", "summary": "\nAfter years of false starts, are we on the brink of a breakthrough in improving relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with the Taliban and al-Qaeda on both sides of the border suffering an array of defeats and deaths?\n\n"}

The claims of mistreatment for which the MoD is criticised are - in the scheme of things - relatively minor.\nBut yet the ministry does also have itself to blame because it was forced to agree to the inquiry after it was criticised for a \"lamentable\" failure to disclose relevant information to the courts - including the fact that three of the detainees had complained of their treatment to the Red Cross.\nLawyers acting for several Iraqi families had originally claimed some men taken from the battlefield were mistreated and killed at Camp Abu Naji and Shaibah Logistics Base.\nBut they withdrew those allegations - vigorously denied by the MoD - in March this year after conceding there was \"insufficient material\" to support those accusations.\nSir Thayne explained that the bodies of the dead Iraqis were taken from the battlefield because British forces were searching for a suspect in the murders of six Royal Military Policemen in Majar-al-Kabir in June 2003.\nHe said removing the bodies had led to \"rumours, stories and speculation\" being spread among the local population .\nSir Thayne said perhaps the \"most significant lie of many\" was that 19-year-old Hamid Al-Sweady - after whom the inquiry was named - had been alive when he was captured.\nHe said: \"Such assertions as that undoubtedly played a part in the persistence of the completely false allegations that Iraqi men had been detained alive and then in effect murdered at Camp Abu Naji.\"\nIn a House of Commons statement, Mr Fallon said the findings were \"incontrovertible\".\n\"British soldiers did not carry out the atrocities that had been falsely attributed to them,\" he told MPs.\nMr Fallon said it was \"shameful\" that the allegations of murder were only withdrawn in March.\nHe said the conduct of some of the lawyers acting for the detainees would be investigated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority.\nHe called on those lawyers to issue an \"unequivocal apology to the soldiers whose reputations they attempted to traduce\" as well as \"to the taxpayers who have had to pay the cost of exposing these lies\".\nJohn Dickinson of Public Interest Lawyers, which represented some of the families of Iraqis who made accusations against British soldiers, said it was not his place to apologise for the \"situation which arose\", adding that the inquiry could have been dealt with \"more speedily\".\nShadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said: \"None of what the report found justifies what the inquiry said was untruthful evidence and deliberate lies from the accusers.

And this location, the mission team believes, is just off the top of the \"head\" of the duck-shaped comet.\nThe orbiting Rosetta satellite photographed this general location on 12, 13 and 14 December, with each image then scanned by eye for any bright pixels that might be Philae. But no positive detection has yet been made.\nRosetta has now moved further from 67P, raising its altitude from 20km to 30km, and there is no immediate plan to go back down (certainly, not to image Philae's likely location).\nEven if they cannot locate it, scientists are confident the little probe will eventually make its whereabouts known.\nAs 67P moves closer to the Sun, lighting conditions for the robot should improve, allowing its solar cells to recharge the battery system.\nThe latest assessment suggests communications could be re-established in the May/June timeframe, with Philae distributing enough electricity to its instruments to resume operations around September.\nThis would be at perihelion - the time when the comet is closest to the Sun (185 million km away) and at its most active.\nScientists continue to pore over the data Philae managed to send back before going into hibernation.\nSome of the results - together with ongoing Rosetta observations - were reported at the recent American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.\nHighlights include a clearer idea of the nature of the comet's surface. Researchers say this appears to be covered in many places by a soft, dusty \"soil\" about 15-20cm in depth.\nUnderneath this is a very hard layer, which is thought to be mainly sintered ice.\nThe conference had the rare opportunity to see pictures from Rosetta's Osiris camera system.\nThese high-resolution images are not normally shown publicly because the camera team has been given an exclusive period to study the data and make discoveries.\nAmong them was a shot looking into a pit on the surface, revealing an array of rounded features that the Osiris team has nicknamed \"dinosaur eggs\".\nThese features have a preferred scale of about 2-3m and may be evidence of the original icy blocks that came together 4.5 billion years ago to build the comet.\nThe dino eggs have been seen at a number of locations, including in cliff walls.\nEarly interpretations of the general surface of the comet indicate that many structures are probably the result of collapse over internal voids.\nAlthough a small body just 4km across, 67P's gravity is still strong enough to shape depressions and arrange fallen boulders.\nA good example of this is in \"Hapi\" valley - the giant gorge that forms the \"neck\" of the comet.\nIt contains a string of large blocks at its base, which one Osiris team-member argued very likely fell from the nearby vertical cliff dubbed \"Hathor\".\nAll the surface features on 67P carry names that follow an ancient Egyptian theme.\nHapi was revered as a god of the Nile.

{"id": "30691779", "document": "We know that stars slow down over time, but until recently there was little data to support exact calculations.\nFor the first time, a US team has now measured the spin speed of stars that are more than one billion years old - and it matches what they predicted.\nThe finding resolves a long-standing challenge, allowing astronomers to estimate a star's age to within 10%.\nThe work was presented in Seattle at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society and also appears in the journal Nature.\nEstablishing the age of stars is a central question in astronomy - much like dating fossils is crucial to studying evolution.\nThis method applies to \"cool stars\" - suns about the size of our own, or smaller. These are the most common stars in our galaxy and they also last for a long time.\n\"They act as lamp posts, lighting up even the oldest parts of our galaxy,\" said senior author Dr Soren Meibom from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.\nCool stars also host the vast majority of earth-like planets that we have spotted in the distance.\nMost properties of a star like ours - like its size, mass, brightness and temperature - stay about the same throughout most of its life.\nThis makes figuring out a star's age decidedly tricky.\nThe solution of measuring spin was first proposed in the 1970s and was dubbed \"gyrochronology\" in 2003.\n\"A cool star spins very fast when it's young, but just like a top on a table it gets slower and slower as the star grows older,\" Dr Meibom said.\nBut it is difficult to see a star spinning. Astronomers use sun spots, travelling across the surface, and these only dim its brightness by much less than 1%.\nOld stars are particularly problematic, because they have fewer and smaller spots.\nDr Meibom's team used images from the very sensitive Kepler space telescope, which has been trailing Earth around the Sun since 2009.\nThey managed to measure spin speeds for 30 stars in a specific cluster known to be 2.5 billion years old.\nThis cluster, known as NGC 6819, plugs what Dr Meibom called a \"four-billion-year gap\" in our knowledge of stellar spin.\nBefore the Kepler mission, we only had data from very cool stars in very young clusters, all less than 0.6 billion years old and all spinning fairly fast (about once a week).\nIn 2011, Dr Meibom's team used Kepler images to report on a different cluster, the one-billion-year-old NGC 6811. Its cool stars spin about once every 10 days.\nBut beyond that, the only star we knew both age and spin rate for was our own sun - 4.6 billion years old, with a spin period of 26 days.\n\"The construction of the cool star clock was on hold,\" Dr Meibom said.\nNow, the clock is looking good. The sun-like stars in the freshly studied cluster sit squarely and satisfyingly in the gap, spinning about every 18 days.\n\"These new data show, with real observations, that this is on solid ground,\" Dr Meibom told BBC News.\n\"We can get age as accurately as about 10% from this method.\"\nHe added that this is a big improvement on some other methods for guessing stars' age, where the margin of error for cool stars can reach 100%.\nRuth Angus, a PhD student researching gyrochronology at the University of Oxford, said the results were \"a really big deal\" for the field.\n\"More evidence has been slowly accumulating that lots of stars do seem to follow this pattern, but how reliably stars fall onto this relation is a bit of an unknown,\" Ms Angus told the BBC.\n\"This cluster will certainly help with our understanding of how good gyrochronology is as a method, and how valid it is.\n\"It shows that these stars are doing what they're expected to do, and everything's peachy.\"\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter.", "summary": "\nAstronomers have proved that they can accurately tell the age of a star from how fast it is spinning.\n\n"}

What he or she doesn't spend on petrol - perhaps £4bn in total - is likely to be spent elsewhere, so boosting the economy in other ways.\nSo if falling prices are good for individuals and the economy, how can inflation also be beneficial?\nIn the example of falling oil prices, the motorist probably doesn't have much choice as to whether to buy petrol or not. But imagine if the price of the car itself were to start falling. Instead of buying yourself a new car this year, why not buy it next year, when it might be hundreds of pounds cheaper? A little inflation encourages you to buy sooner - and that boosts economic growth.\nAnyone with a mortgage or a loan benefits from inflation, as it has the effect of eroding debt. In the 1960s my father bought a house for £11,000. But with inflation peaking at around 13% in the late 70s, his wages were rising fast too - meaning the mortgage repayments were taking an ever smaller share of his income. By contrast, deflation - or falling prices - increases the real value of debts. Not a good place to be.\nRising prices make it easier for companies to put up wages. They also give employers the flexibility not to increase wages by as much as inflation, but still offer their staff some sort of rise. In a world of zero inflation some companies might be forced to cut wages.\nThat would not be good for morale, recruitment or productivity. For most of the last five years inflation has been running ahead of wage rises, but thanks to inflation, wages have also been rising, even if the money doesn't go as far.\nThe government has a huge debt, which is getting bigger thanks to a deficit of £90bn. It would dearly love to see that eroded by inflation, which in turn would see its own income rise. As long as there's a good dose of inflation in the system, tax revenue should go up, even if the economy is stagnant.\nWhen inflation is too high of course, it is not good for the economy or individuals. Inflation will always reduce the value of money, unless interest rates are higher than inflation. And the higher inflation gets, the less chance there is that savers will see any real return on their money. Although in theory that should be good for the economy, by encouraging people to spend rather than save.\nHigh inflation - as Gordon Brown used to remind us when he was chancellor - is also a cause of boom and bust in the economy. It therefore produces low growth and higher unemployment.\nIf inflation in the UK exceeds that of other countries, it can also erode competitiveness.\nMost central banks favour an inflation target that is in the region of 2% to 2.5%. The Bank of England's target of 2% under the CPI measure is fairly typical. Some economists argue there should be a higher target in times of recession, such as 3%. This can promote higher growth, by keeping interest rates lower for longer.\nBut whatever the precise level, most do agree that a little dose of inflation is absolutely essential.\n\"The most important thing to remember is that inflation is not an act of God, that inflation is not a catastrophe of the elements or a disease that comes like the plague,\" said the Austrian philosopher and economist Ludwig von Mises.\n\"Inflation is a policy.\"", "summary": "\nSo, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, is filling his fountain pen, and looking for a stamp.\n\n"}

Tories?\", presumably designed to get the audience jeering.\n\"Come to think of it,\" says Dr Wollaston, \"When people call me a Tory they're often doing so pejoratively: if they're being nice they're more likely to call me a Conservative\".\n\"You may hear the word 'Tory' and think of someone with a Scouse accent saying it, perhaps even with the word 'scum' attached,\" jokes another Conservative politician, Bernard Jenkin, adding, \"It depends on the emotion attached to the words. It's really not that important.\"\nGiven some of the negative connotations attached to \"Tory\", it's perhaps not surprising that party officials prefer the official, more neutral, name. Broadcasters are used to receiving emails from party HQ, asking them to refer to the party as Conservative in the first instance, especially at election time.\nHistory\nThe political term \"Tory\" dates back to the \"Exclusion Crisis\" which took place between 1679 and 1681 during the reign of Charles II.\nTwo political factions had emerged in Parliament: those who wanted to exclude Charles' brother James, the Duke of York, from succeeding the king because he was a Roman Catholic (the Whigs) and those who supported his rights to the throne (the Tories). The Tory campaign prevailed and James became the Stuart king James II.\nBoth terms were originally pejorative:- Whig came from an old word for yokel or \"country bumpkin\"; Tory is derived from the Irish Gaelic word tÃ³raidhe, meaning outlaw.\n\"Simplistically you could say Tories were Cavaliers and Whigs were Roundheads,\" explains Dr David Seawright from Leeds University, a Conservative Party expert.\nAlthough Tories began by supporting a Catholic heir's rights to succession, they went on to be associated with Anglicanism as well as strong monarchist and patriotic sympathies.\n\"Patriotism is the first, and most deeply rooted, element of the party's character,\" writes the party's official historian, Lord Lexden, in a 2014 guide.\nThe term \"Conservative\" first started to be used widely in the 1830s under the leadership of Sir Robert Peel. He re-interpreted the key elements of the old Tory tradition, effectively modernising the party under the banner of support for social reform and free trade.\nWhile the Tory party under the Duke of Wellington had been strongly opposed to the Reform Bill which extended voting rights, Peel accepted it, declaring his support in the Tamworth Manifesto of 1834.\nDespite the adoption of a new name, \"Tory\" endured and the two terms became interchangeable, with the older name appearing in official publications such as Lord Hailsham's \"Toryism and Tomorrow\" lecture of 1957.\nIn the early 20th century, both terms were briefly eclipsed by a new name, \"Unionist\", to reflect the party's resistance to Irish Home Rule. In the latter part of the century, \"Conservative\" emerged as the official name.\n\"Tory\" was also used during the American War of Independence to refer to colonists who were loyal to the British monarchy. The term has also endured in Canada where centre-right Conservatives are known as Tories.\n1. In the 17th Century, one of the dispossessed Irish, who became outlaws, subsisting by plundering and killing the English settlers and soldiers; a bog-trotter, a rapparee; later, often applied to any Irish Papist or Royalist in arms.\n2. With capital T: A nickname given 1679-80 by the Exclusioners to those who opposed the exclusion of James, Duke of York (a Roman Catholic) from the succession to the Crown.\n3.  Hence, from 1689, the name of one of the two great parliamentary and political parties in England, and (at length) in Great Britain.\nUsually with capital initial: a supporter or member of the Conservative Party of Great Britain, or a similar party elsewhere; a Tory. In early use: one who espoused the policies of Sir Robert Peel.\nSource: Oxford English Dictionary\nThe evolutionary way in which the party has been described over time reflects what many historians see as its most essential and enduring feature: adaptability.\nUnlike Labour, the Conservative Party was never officially founded and did not even have a written constitution until 1998.\nLord Lexden says flexibility in the face of change has been a strength.\n\"As Britain evolved from monarchical government to democracy and from intense disputes with a large religious element to purely secular controversies, the Party constantly adapted to change and frequently led the process of change. That has been the secret of its success,\" he writes.\nActivists at the 2014 Conservative Party conference in Birmingham did not seem to mind being called Conservatives or Tories.\nRebecca Chappell, Windsor, 25\n\"I feel very proud to be a Tory or a Conservative.

I thought, it doesn't need to be, and we had the ability to work something new.\"\nHe says his company's current models use nearly 500 individual variables to predict the propensity of an individual consumer to default.\n\"The key is to aggregate as much data as possible,\" he says, \"the better our predictive modelling capability is, the cheaper price we can offer to an individual customer.\"\nAlex Letts, Ffrees's chief executive, says \"You won't find me saying banks are crooks - wrong; they have a problem, they can't make money.\"\nBy offering current accounts for free, he says, retail banks lose money on the vast majority of them.\n\"It's not a good model - 60-80% of the bank's customers are people out of whom the banks only make money by charging for their mistakes or helping them get into debt.\"\n\"This creates the foundation for a quite adversarial relationship,\" he adds, \"and this all blew up in the miss-selling scandals.\"\nIt was the unprofitability of most personal banking, not payday lending, that caused the last banking crisis, he says - and it hasn't gone away.\nThe challenge, then, is \"finding a way of being able to say to people, you have to pay for this stuff, man up, it can cost you up to Â£10 a month to run a current account, but won't cost you any more,\" as opposed to making profit by sleight of hand.\nThe answer, he says, is thinking of a current account as data.\n\"It's a spreadsheet, sitting on a mainframe somewhere - there is no pile of gold in a vault that is associated with you.\"\n\"What you need is something to provide a very slick spreadsheet manipulation technology, to give you an amazing experience, and help you manage this little pile of poo that is your money, that causes you so much stress in life, and get you to a better place.\"\nIf Mr Letts says retail banks' personal current accounts are unsustainable, ZestFinance's Mr Merrill argues the maths behind their loans are 60 years out of date.\nIn the 1950s, says the former Google vice president, the application of new maths - logistic regression - to credit bureau data, offered a standardised way of offering credit, and expanded the amount of available with mass social impact.\nBut logistic regression is hypersensitive to data that is missing or wrong.\nAs a result of data being slightly warped, he says, \"people are given very low credit scores and being priced out of the credit market unfairly.

I think it's a real shame that this has happened.\n\"I think there are many reasons why Strathallan is not the right place for this - the road network is not suitable for traffic of that volume, and there is an abundance of wildlife at the site. There's a private water supply, health and safety issues, and I think the negative impact it could have on the established tourist industry.\"\nJamie and Debs Roberts are part-owners of the Strathallan Estate, and insist protecting the local environment has always been their priority.\n\"We're conservationists at heart,\" said Mrs Roberts.\n\"We've been organic farmers for the last 20 years. Looking after wildlife is not something that's different to us or a conflict for us - it's core to what we do.\n\"Where I have comfort is that all of the experts who have come in and looked and assessed the wildlife issues here at Strathallan, all of their recommended actions are being adhered to. Where we have specific species where there are actions to look after them, that's all being implemented so they are being protected.\n\"I'd also look at the work DF Concerts did at Balado - they were working alongside a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and the conditions for that environmental management is much higher than anything that we would have here.\"\nAttracting more than 80,000 music fans every year, the festival generates a significant economic boost for Scotland - and Perthshire.\nA study carried out by Glasgow-based consultancy Ekos estimated that the 2014 event generated Â£15m for the Scottish economy, and Â£2.7m locally in Perthshire, with one in five attendees travelling from outside Scotland.\nHowever, Mrs Mackintosh claimed the event might actually harm the local tourist trade.\nShe said: \"While I agree that T in the Park is fantastic for the Scottish economy, that would be the case wherever it was in Scotland, and I would question how beneficial it would be to the local economy. I would question that there's a significant net economic benefit.\n\"I think this part of Perthshire is already on the map - Gleaneagles has done a great job of that with the Ryder Cup and the G8.\n\"Certainly some businesses and people will benefit - and no-one more than the castle owners. But tourists come here for the landscape and the wildlife and the scenery, our local shops and art galleries, and that part of the economy would suffer.\"\nWhile the Roberts' are unapologetic that they would \"generate revenue\" from having the festival as a tenant, they insisted the move would represent \"an opportunity\" for Strathallan as a whole.\nMrs Roberts said: \"What it came down to for us was that there was going to be a massive change, but with it come a whole raft of benefits, not just for the estate but for the wider area.\n\"I'm actually more convinced now than I was.\n\"In the last months and years we've had so many chances to challenge DF Concerts and to get answers to questions, and at every stage they've been forthright and transparent. I'm happier now today than I've ever been with it.\"\nMr Roberts added: \"We are guardians and custodians of this area, and we make the decisions - we won't let it be spoiled.\n\"It's the beauty that brought DF Concerts here.

But who else will be there?\nMr Mundell is a man who knows politics and his constituency well, having been born in Dumfries and schooled in Lockerbie.\nHis entrance into the political arena was typical of so many - he joined the Young Conservatives at the age of 14; went on to study law at Edinburgh University; after graduating he became a lawyer and was elected a local councillor.\nHowever, that early journey was not with one party. His head was turned by the Social Democrats which he backed in the early 1980s.\nMr Mundell was elected an SDP councillor, serving on Dumfries and Galloway Council until 1987.\nBy 1999 he was back with the Tories and found himself part of the new intake of the new Scottish Parliament where he was the first MSP to ask a question.\nHe was returned to Holyrood in 2003, but in 2005 he set his sights on becoming an MP and stood for the Westminster seat of Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweedale.\nMr Mundell beat the Labour candidate by 1,739 votes and headed down to the House of Commons as the only Conservative MP in Scotland.\nWhen Edinburgh Zoo welcomed two pandas from China a running joke began that there were more pandas in Scotland than there were Scottish Tory MPs.\nBy BBC Scotland Westminster correspondent David Porter\nDavid Mundell will have to deliver new devolution for Scotland, which is backed by all the main parties\nBut he also has to be aware that he has many English colleagues who would like to see the power of Scottish MPs reduced.\nHe has the advantage that he knows the territory very well.\nEssentially he has to decide with his Cabinet colleagues whether they go forward with the Smith Commission with more income tax powers for Scotland and more borrowing and welfare payments, or whether they go even further, as some people have said, and move to a more federal structure.\nThat is something the Cabinet will decide and that is something Mr Mundell will have to sell.\nThe first half of 2007 marked an uncomfortable period for Mr Mundell. It began with embarrassing headlines ahead of his party's Scottish conference in March when a Daily Record front page read: \"Scots Tories are clueless - by Scotland's only Tory MP.\"\nThe story was based on a four-page memo written some nine months earlier in which Mr Mundell slammed the Holyrood Tory bench as having a \"lack of thinkers\".\nIt also contained a dig at the Scottish leader of the time, Annabel Goldie. Mr Mundell did not stop there and went on to call for the immediate replacement of the then Scottish Tory chairman Peter Duncan.\nThe public washing of dirty linen - just months ahead of the 2007 Holyrood election - prompted Conservative leader David Cameron to pay public tribute to both Ms Goldie and Mr Duncan.\nHe said: \"Annabel has a no-nonsense approach and is addressing the issues that really matter in Scotland. The party in Scotland is in better health now than it has been for many years and is running an effective campaign.\"\nThere was a notable no mention for Shadow Scottish Secretary of State Mr Mundell.\nThe Holyrood election took place a few months after this episode and the party returned 17 members, one down on the previous electoral contest.\nAt Westminster, Mr Mundell - whose nickname is \"Fluffy\" - continued in his shadow Scottish secretary role.\nAnd on taking to his feet in the House of Commons for the first Scottish Questions following the Holyrood poll, ironic cheers greeted him from the Labour government benches.\nBBC Scotland political editor Brian Taylor noted at the time: \"MPs were, of course, indulging in a collective chortle over the leaked memo.\n\"Fluffy fought back, rather well in fact. He noted, acerbically, that at least he knew the names of his Scottish comrades.\"\nThat was a reference to the then health secretary Patricia Hewitt who had repeatedly called Scotland's Labour first minister between 2001 and 2007 Jack McDonnell instead of Jack McConnell.\nIn 2010, a coalition government between the Tories and the Lib Dems did not result in the top Scottish job going to Mr Mundell.\nPrime Minister Mr Cameron had to make concessions and one of those was picking a Scottish Lib Dem MP for the role of Secretary of State for Scotland.\nFirst up was Michael Moore who saw through the arrangements for the Scottish independence referendum.\nWhen he departed the scene, his Lib Dem colleague Alistair Carmichael saw through the independence referendum itself.\nHowever, while the main job switched hands, Mr Mundell worked the full five years as undersecretary of state for Scotland.\nThis May's election result saw Mr Mundell being sent to Westminster for a third time (again as the sole Scots Tory MP), and finally the Scottish portfolio became his.\nBut what will the job of Scottish Secretary be like in 2015 and what challenges does Mr Mundell face?\nThe Union-supporting Conservatives were on the winning side when Scotland's electorate voted 55% to 45% against independence.\nHowever, the \"No\" vote has not marked the end of constitutional politics as a new devolved settlement for Scotland is under way.\nIt is likely Mr Mundell will play a key role seeing that settlement through.\nThe Smith Commission recommendations have to be enacted and there are already political rows emerging.\nOn day one of his job, Mr Mundell said UK government plans to scrap the Human Rights Act would apply to Scotland.\nThat led the Scottish government to say it would \"robustly oppose\" withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).\nThe Scotland Act (1998) states that all legislation passed by Holyrood must be compatible with the ECHR, however, Mr Mundell told BBC Scotland new legislation would apply north of the border.\nIt is sure to be the case that during the next five years the words of rare political breed Mr Mundell will be listened to, scrutinised and criticised.", "summary": "\nThe Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale MP David Mundell is a rare political breed given his position as the sole Scottish Conservative representative in the House of Commons.\n\n"}

People who wear contacts are particularly susceptible to the infection, which attacks the cornea. Water-borne bacteria and other bugs, such as acanthamoeba, can attach to contact lenses during swimming and cause infection. This is particularly a problem in public pools where there can often be traces of urine and faecal matter.\nIf you want to swim with your contacts in, use a pair of tight-fitting swimming goggles to help protect your eyes.\nIt's essential that you disinfect them as this prevents harmful organisms building up on the lens.\nWash, rinse and dry your hands thoroughly before handling your lenses to prevent spreading nasty germs\nIt may be tempting to cut corners, especially if you are away from home and have forgotten to bring your lens-cleaning kit. But don't. Tap water, although safe to drink, can still carry bacteria that is harmful to the eyes.\nSaliva is not a hygienic way to clean or wet your lenses.\nTake care not to catch the lens or the eye with your fingernails\nDon't mix your right and left lenses up - get into the habit of inserting and removing the same lens first\nBefore you put lenses in, check they are not damaged or inside-out. The lens should be shaped like a cup. If it is inside-out it will be shaped like a saucer, with the edges facing out\nGive the lens a rinse with saline or conditioning solution (depending on the type of lens) and place it on to the tip of the index finger of your dominant hand\nPull the lower eyelid down with the middle finger of the dominant hand and lift the upper eyelid with your other hand and gently place the lens on the eye without blinking\nWhen the lens is on the eye, close the eye slowly and blink gently a few times until the lens begins to feel comfortable\nTo remove soft lenses, keep your chin down and look upwards\nSeparate you eyelids in the same way as before and slide your contact lens down on to the white of your eye. Then gently pinch the lens with your thumb and index finger. Never use your nails\nTo remove hard lenses, place your middle and ring finger at the outer corner of your eye and pull your eyelids tight over towards your ear. Blink - the lens should come out\nDispose of or store the lenses appropriately.\nNever ignore problems or discomfort. Remove the contact lens and seek medical advice.", "summary": "\nSpecialists at Moorfields Eye hospital have noticed a rise in eye infections among contact-lens wearers and are warning users to take extra care.\n\n"}

{"id": "32985764", "document": "The Fifa president has survived repeated accusations of corruption against his organisation. Sepp the survivor would be a fitting moniker. So for him to go, days after winning an election with a heavy majority, there must be something significant happening behind the scenes.\nThe rising pressure from the US investigation into corruption looks the most likely source. Just hours after his resignation, reports emerged in US media that the FBI had begun investigating him directly.\nSpeaking on stage, the 79-year-old looked diminished, a far cry from his usual bombastic self. Is it possible he knew something the rest of the world didn't?\nAs he resigned Mr Blatter suggested he wanted to reform the sport before he handed over the reins to his successor. Perhaps this was a plan to exit gracefully and secure his legacy, marketing himself as the man who saved Fifa.\nFifa's head of audit and compliance, Domenico Scala, has promised large-scale reform and said that \"nothing is off the table\".\nHowever, as always with Fifa it is a case of believe it when you see it. All the reforms will have to be voted through by Fifa members, who have previously voted them down. But with two ongoing criminal investigations and pressure from sponsors, perhaps this will focus minds.\nOne of the key reforms Mr Scala has proposed is term limits for Fifa's president. Remarkably, despite serving 17 years in charge, Mr Blatter is actually only the third-longest serving president. Mr Scala has also said that he will reveal the salary of the president, something that has previously been hidden.\nMr Scala also wishes for Fifa to take over integrity checks on those who represent the different regional football federations. Under the current rules, the federations perform checks on their representatives, meaning that they are essentially checking on themselves.\nBoth have been mired in controversy surrounding their bidding process. One key question for the new Fifa president is whether he will release US attorney Michael Garcia's report into the bidding process for both tournaments. Mr Garcia was commissioned by Fifa to carry out the investigation but resigned after Fifa refused to release his full report, preferring instead to release a summary that Mr Garcia described as inaccurate.\nAnalysts suggest that it is still a relatively safe bet that Russia will keep its World Cup. More than anything, time is on its side as in less than two months the draw for the qualifying rounds takes place. Three years is not a long time to prepare for a World Cup and the cost is extortionate - the 2014 World Cup cost $4bn. Only a few countries in the world have sufficient stadia already built, Germany and Britain amongst them, and even they would need significant refurbishment.\nQatar looks very vulnerable. FA Chairman Greg Dyke has already said \"if I was in Qatar I wouldn't be very confident\". However, ever since the outcry of its award began the Qataris have been bullish - any attempt to take the World Cup from them would be fought with every resource at their disposal, including legal options. It would take proof of widespread corruption for it to be removed, although with the Swiss police currently investigating the bid this is clearly not off the table.\nThis question will define the organisation. Although in the heat of the moment a reforming candidate appears the logical answer, it is unlikely to be as clear cut as that.\nA large majority of nations voted for Mr Blatter, many of whom have done very well out of his presidency - will they vote for a candidate cut from a similar cloth?\nHowever, without Mr Blatter in the field this is going to be an unprecedented election. His presence and certainty of victory has put off candidates from running in the past so this could reopen the field.\nUefa President Michel Platini is seen as a frontrunner but will need to find a way to galvanise support outside Europe. He was widely seen as Mr Blatter's successor until a falling out a few years ago, after which Mr Platini became a vocal critic of the president. Mr Platini was a key supporter of the Qatar World Cup, the award of which appears to have sparked the process that led to the downfall of Mr Blatter. Mr Platini must hope he is not dragged into any of the fallout from investigations into its award.\nThe man who came second to Mr Blatter in Friday's elections, Prince Ali of Jordan, is already being touted as a possible candidate.\nOne person it definitely won't be is Jeffrey Webb. He was being groomed as Mr Blatter's successor but instead is inside a Swiss prison cell following his indictment by the Americans.\nFifa was clearly in need of reform, it cannot be healthy that an organisation that runs world football is despised by so many fans. So, anything that can help restore faith in it can only be a good thing.\nHowever, one plus to take away from this is that despite widespread corruption allegations that crossed continents, there seems to be no sign that the actual integrity of the sport is in doubt.\nAs cycling and athletics doping scandals have shown, as soon as fans stop believing in what they see the sport is in serious trouble. At least in football, fans can believe  that what is happening on the pitch is not corrupted.", "summary": "\nSepp Blatter's shock resignation as Fifa president has rocked world football.

{"id": "33140732", "document": "The hydraulic fracturing has started again in Denton, and so too have the protests.\nMonths ago, the town became the first in Texas to ban hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in their area.\nFracking is a method of shale gas extraction that uses large amounts of water pumped at high pressure into channels drilled into rock to release gas.\nIt has been a boon for US energy production and the focus of major protest from environmental groups\nBut while this part of Texas is no stranger to oil, the fight back against fracking was driven by extreme proximity.\n\"There are nearly 300 wells in the city limits of Denton, but this neighbourhood was sandwiched by two gas well pad sites,\" says Dr Adam Briggle, a Denton resident and an environmental studies professor at University of North Texas.\n\"It was when people saw this and how close to homes they were drilling that we realised we had to look after each other here.\"\nCampaigners turned to the ballot box. They received the required signatures to put a town-wide fracking ban to a vote and took on powerful Texas energy companies.\n\"They threw everything at us, but the harder they worked to turn it into a knock-down political fight, the more it turned against them,\" Dr Briggle says.\nIn November of last year, Denton voted overwhelmingly to ban fracking, and the drilling stopped immediately.\n\"It felt like vindication, an indication that grassroots democracy can still work in this country,\" Dr Briggle says.\nNot everyone thought so.  The very next day, two lawsuits were filed in Austin, the Texas capital.\n\"What was at stake here were the rights of those families, mineral owners, that were being denied access to their property which is protected under the US constitution,\" says Todd Staples, President of the Texas Oil and Gas Association.\n\"Our operators were very willing to work to find solutions, but the path that Denton took was unsustainable,\" he says.\nMr Staples has been one of those lobbying not only to overturn the ban in Denton, but also to ensure such a ban never happens again anywhere in Texas.\nAnd he has gotten what he wanted. In May, the state passed a bill that in essence, prohibits bans on fracking.\nFracking has undoubtedly revolutionised the energy industry here.\nBut there are questions about the environmental impact and the nuisance of drilling sites near residential areas. It's what moved Denton residents to act.\nAt a site on a hill just outside the town, a tall barricade has been erected.\nThis is the site where fracking was about to begin in November 2014, just as Denton voted for the ban.  Just days after it was overturned, trucks and heavy machinery are rolling back in.\nAs we spoke to residents, it was clear many were not opposed in principle to fracking, but just the way it had been done in their town.\n\"I'm not totally against fracking, I just think they should give more thought and consideration to people already there,\" says a woman who didn't want to give her name, but who is one of the closest neighbours to the new fracking site.\nThere's also a feeling that both the energy companies and politicians who had supported fracking behaved arrogantly.\n\"People are trying to frame us as being crazy environmentalists,\" says Dwight Jillik, who lives close to a fracking site with his wife and two young children. \"But this issue rallied this community in a way that has nothing to do with left, right or moderate views.\"\nJillik says the companies just didn't \"give a damn\".\n\"No one ever returned our calls or answered our letters about our concerns about fracking.\"\nTexas is a state with a reputation for supporting local control. Many Denton residents are angry the fracking has resumed, despite their vote.\nMr Staples argues the vote to ban fracking in Denton was motivated by scaremongering.\n\"The opponents of the oil and gas industry were providing information that water quality was damaged, air quality was damaged and gave misinformation about what was occurring,\" he says.\nBut even for many of those with environmental concerns, like Dr Adam Briggle, there is now a new dimension to their outrage over what has happened in Denton.\n\"I think the biggest point now is not what the rules are, but who gets to make them,\" Dr Briggle says, adding the new law strips Texas communities of their power.\nSoon after we spoke to him, Adam Briggle was arrested for blocking an entrance to a fracking site.\nHe has now been released, but admits that it is hard to see what avenues are now available to him and others who do not want fracking near their homes.", "summary": "\nWhen a Texas town voted to ban fracking inside city limits, it was a shock to the oil-friendly state.

{"id": "33141819", "document": "There have been calls for a referendum on whether or not the UK should be in the EU almost since the original referendum back in 1975. click here for the history of calls for another EU vote\nIn a long awaited speech Prime Minister David Cameron says that if the Conservatives win the next election they would seek to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU and then give the British people the \"simple choice\" by the end of 2017 between staying in the EU under those terms or leaving the EU. His speech comes against a background of polls suggesting UK Independence Party support at 10%.  Read full story on the speech.\nThe European Union Referendum Bill was unveiled in the Queen's Speech. This is the UK legislation required to allow the referendum to take place. It has now cleared Parliament and become law, after the government twice saw off attempts in the House of Lords to lower the proposed voting age in the in-out poll to 16. At the same time as the bill made its parliamentary journey, Mr Cameron was seeking approval from other EU leaders for the reforms he wants to achieve before the referendum can take place.\nThe first EU summit after David Cameron won an unexpected majority in the UK general election. The summit ended up being dominated by the migrant crisis and Greek debt crisis. But Mr Cameron used the meeting - made up of all the EU's heads of state - to formally set out his aims. Speaking after it, he said he was delighted the process of \"reform and renegotiation\" of the UK's membership of the EU was \"properly under way\".\nA new group charged with handling issues relating to the EU referendum began its work. Headed by British official Jonathan Faull, it reports to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\nSome thought this would be the summit that Mr Cameron sealed the deal with his EU counterparts, but that turned out to be a bit premature. Instead EU leaders had their first \"frank\" discussions about the UK requests including Mr Cameron's attempts to convince sceptical EU leaders to accept his plans to limit benefits for migrants - one of the key sticking points in the renegotiations. European Council President Donald Tusk said the discussions should \"pave the way\" for a deal by February.\nDavid Cameron says Conservative ministers will be able to campaign to leave the EU while remaining in the government. However, he says this suspension of the normal rules of collective ministerial responsibility will only apply once agreement on a deal with the rest of the EU is reached.\nA landmark moment as the European Council publishes a draft blueprint for the proposed changes to the UK's membership of the EU. The document includes a so-called emergency brake on the payment of in-work benefits and powers for the UK Parliament to join with other countries to block EU regulations. David Cameron says the detail needs to be ironed out but the settlement is the best he could have achieved from a \"standing start\" and is worth \"fighting for\". Home Secretary Theresa May says the package offers the \"basis for a deal\" but many Tory colleagues disagree, saying the PM failed to get nearly all the objectives he originally set out in his 2013 Bloomberg speech.\nDefending the package in the House of Commons, the prime minister insists it will see powers returned to the UK Parliament in a string of areas and will leave Britain \"better and stronger\". But the Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who Out campaigners are looking to join their side, says that the PM is making \"the best of a bad job\" and more guarantees are needed over enhanced sovereignty.\nAfter round-the-clock negotiations in Brussels, David Cameron gets the 27 other EU member states to sign up to a package of reforms. He does not get everything he wanted - he has to water down some of the welfare curbs at the insistence of Eastern European members - but he does get an exemption from \"ever closer union\" and the four year ban on in-work benefits for new arrivals. He claims the deal tackles the British public's \"frustrations\" with the EU and ensures the country will never be part of an EU \"superstate\" - but critics say it does nothing to tackle high levels of immigration and take powers back from Brussels.\nDavid Cameron says the UK's in/out referendum will be held on 23 June this year - as widely predicted. If he had not got a deal on 18-19 February he would have had to to return to Brussels at the end of February for a special summit or wait until the next scheduled gathering at the start of March.\nHis cabinet colleagues start to come out in favour or against Britain's membership as the rival campaigns kick into top gear.\nDavid Cameron makes a statement to Parliament, allowing MPs to debate the deal he has reached in Brussels and the choice facing the British people in the referendum.\nSecondary legislation  is due to be laid before Parliament paving the way for a referendum. The Electoral Commission will designate the official Leave and Remain campaigns, which will get access to public funds, a Â£7m spending limit and TV broadcasts.\nThe government ruled out holding the EU referendum on on 5 May, the same day as elections to devolved parliaments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and for London's mayor.\nBut the SNP has argued that holding the EU vote at the end of June will still conflict with Scottish election campaign. Voters in many English local authorities will also go to the polls, making 5 May the biggest set of elections - outside of a general election - for some years.\nBritain goes to the polls to answer the question: \"Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\"\nIn the event of a Leave vote, a country can withdraw from the EU two years after notifying the European Council of its intention to leave. However, leaving would still involve \"complex and probably lengthy negotiations\", a Parliamentary briefing paper concluded. Talks would be held on the future of the UK's relationship with the EU, including whether it could still have access to the single market. Resolving all this could take some time. David Cameron has promised to step down as Conservative leader before the next general election in 2020, meaning that - whatever the outcome of the referendum - this period is likely to be dominated by the race to succeed him.\nFrench presidential elections take place in May 2017. The UK government had been keen to get its EU negotiations wrapped up by this time for fear of Mr Cameron's demands being trumped by French domestic politics, with candidates seeking to win favour at home with a tough stance against the UK. German parliamentary elections take place in September 2017.

There should have been an independent, non-party campaign for a No vote that the three political parties then each supported in their own way with their own supporters.\n\"This idea that you bring the grandees of the three Westminster parties together to come and tell Scotland what to do - it's a daft idea, it's always going to be problematic but nobody would listen, and organise the campaign in a different way.\n\"It is an example of what was wrong with the thinking - the idea that you can dictate to Scotland how it thinks instead of actually listening and engaging with people who are active in Scotland and have got some experience of the situation.\"\nIAIN GRAY\n\"I said to a number of colleagues there that we have to think about the possibility that even if we win the referendum and Scotland remains part of the United Kingdom that what will follow from that will change the next election, and that next election will be 2015 - that election will be about something different, that it will be about Scottish identity and the constitution.\n\"And that for the first time in many Westminster elections the SNP will be able to find a strong relevance, and if that happens then you - Labour MPs - will find yourselves competing against the SNP in the way we had to do in 2011.\n\"And my colleagues said: \"That can't happen.\" I could not convince them that the referendum would change the context. So what I'm saying to you is that that's not a tension.

At his death, he was hailed by some as one of the great figures of the 20th Century Labour movement, even if others remembered him rather less generously as a disorganised and weak leader out of step with the times.\nMr Foot did, though, resemble some modern-day politicians in one respect: he graduated in politics, philosophy and economics from Oxford.\nHe first stood (unsuccessfully) for election in 1935, before going on to become a hugely successful and influential journalist and author.\nHe was also a founding member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and built a reputation as a formidable orator and parliamentarian.\nHe served as Harold Wilson's Employment Secretary in 1974, a tough role at a time of fraught industrial relations, before becoming leader of the House of Commons in 1976.\nMr Foot was elected leader of the Labour Party in 1980, presenting himself as the candidate to unite the warring right and left wings of the party.\nBut Labour continued to tear itself apart after he became leader.\nThere were problems with the Militant Tendency - a group of a few thousand activists bent on turning Labour into a Trotskyist movement.\nThe rifts and divisions worsened with the formation of the breakaway Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981.\nMr Foot soldiered on, presiding over Labour's disastrous defeat at the hands of Margaret Thatcher in the 1983 general election.\nMrs Thatcher won a massive majority of 144.\nLabour won just below 28% of the vote.\nThe defeat was its worst showing since 1918, even though in later years some credited Mr Foot with holding the party together in one of the most turbulent periods in its history.\nThe 1983 election remains a sore point in Labour political folklore.\nMr Foot campaigned on a platform that included:\nThe Labour manifesto, 700 pages long, and in retrospect rather optimistically entitled The New Hope for Britain, did not bother to summarise the policies but instead simply included everything to avoid a bitter public clash between rival factions.\nOne story has it that a policy for socialist puppy farms was only just kept out of the final document.\nIt was later dubbed \"the longest suicide note in history\" by the Labour MP Gerald Kaufman.\nThe Labour campaign itself was a lesson in how not to run for office: it started badly and then fell away.\nAt one point, with Mr Foot under pressure, Labour's campaign committee passed a resolution confirming its confidence in his leadership qualities, only serving to undermine him further, and give new meaning, said critics, to the phrase \"shooting yourself in the Foot\".\nThe 1983 campaign, however, saw two future Labour prime ministers enter the Commons: Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\nPaddy Ashdown and Charles Kennedy, future leaders of the Liberal Democrats, were also elected in 1983, as was the future Tory leader, Michael Howard.\nMr Blair now says the politics of the 1980s belongs firmly in the past, even if it was the time that saw him begin his own journey to the summit of power.\nHuffington Post: In Defence of Michael Foot\nThe Guardian: Should Blair have intervened in Labour's leadership race?

So you have to start by testing the smallest piece first, adding it to the next item and then testing them, and so on.\n\"And as you get to the largest items, it's then very difficult to go back if you have a problem with, say, a detector. As a consequence James Webb has been a long and deliberate process.\"\nThis autumn's cryo campaign will be the third and final one for ISIM and its passengers at Goddard.\nWhen the instruments are inside, they will be exposed to a light source - a fake star, if you will. It will give the instrument teams an opportunity to gather the calibration data they will need to fine-tune Webb when it goes into orbit.\n\"We have another complex piece called the Optical Telescope Simulator, and it takes the place of the telescope, producing a light that simulates a star for each of the instruments,\" explains BegoÃ±a Vila, an engineer with particular responsibility for the Fine Guidance Sensor.\n\"We can then all check things related to that star, like its brightness or the dispersion the instruments get with either a slit or a prism. It confirms that everything works as if there is a real star.\"\nEurope will be heavily involved in the cryo campaign, confirms Marco Sirianni from the European Space Agency.\n\"We are putting together a large team that will come to Goddard and work 24/7 to support the test.\n\"We already have seven people here, but more are coming from the NIRSpec and Miri groups. And this test is very important because it will be a final verification of the modifications that were made at the component level.\"\nThose modifications refer to the underperforming parts of NIRSpec and Miri that were present in the European instruments when they were delivered to Goddard from Germany and the UK.\nThese included degraded detectors and electronics, and, in the case of NIRSpec, a troublesome micro-shutter array intended to tease apart the colours of stars.\nSome of its shutters had the annoying habit of sticking open or closed. All this suspect componentry has now been exchanged.\nWhen ISIM and the instruments emerge from the cryo-vac, they will be joined to the finished telescope structure complete with mirrors.\nBy then, there really will be no mistaking James Webb. But yes, you've guessed it, these joined items then have to be tested again as a single unit. And for that task, they will be shipped in 2016 to Nasa's Johnson centre. It has a giant vacuum chamber that was built originally to run the rule over the Apollo spaceships before they launched.\nOf course, the fear is always that some big problem emerges - that perhaps something breaks or simply does not meet the specifications demanded of it.\nRecently, the part of James Webb that has been in the \"dog house\" is the so-called cryo-cooler for Miri. The instrument will work at just a few degrees above absolute zero and must be actively chilled even in space to get down to the right temperature.\nThe cooler unit is late but it has now been delivered from the American manufacturer to begin its testing programme. Assuming the cryo-cooler passes, Webb stays on track.\nEric Smith told me: \"Right now, we are carrying nine months of funded, scheduled reserve. So, we have nine months of slack in our schedule that can be consumed, or used, before we would think of changing the launch date.\n\"This nine months is about what we had planned five years ago when we re-structured the programme.\"\nBBC Click will have a special report on the James Webb Space Telescope.

but the public rightly expects that this is not abused.\"\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council said it was \"only right\" that officers should be compensated for overtime.\nBy Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent\n\"Overtime does not go sick or take leave.\"\nThat pithy phrase, from Tim Godwin, the former Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner, sums up the usefulness of overtime to a service that has to cope with sudden and unexpected events.\nWhether it's the surveillance officer monitoring a terrorism suspect, the detective constable deployed on a murder investigation, or the civilian staff employee answering calls after hours because a colleague has gone home ill - overtime has a valuable part to play.\nSir Tom Winsor's review recognised that, while also recommending changes designed to reduce the overall bill.\nThe year-on-year increase, identified by 5 live's research, does not mean that work has stalled.\nBut it's interesting to note that some overtime payments appear to be connected to staff shortages.\nAs the police workforce shrinks further, it may well be that existing officers and staff are increasingly asked to plug the gaps.\nFigures for 39 forces in England and Wales show the overtime bill rose from £307.1m in 2013/14 to £313.2m in 2014/15.\nThe Metropolitan Police accounted for about a third of the overall bill, while in two other forces, Bedfordshire and Cleveland, the overtime bill went up by 50% - explained in part by gaps in recruitment.\nThe Met said officers earning the highest amounts were in specialist roles, where working time was determined by the operational circumstances.\nAn officer at West Midlands Police earned £32,702 in overtime working in a contact centre.\nInspector Tony Morris from that force said \"recruitment in this business area has been on hold\" due to a reorganisation.\n\"This means the department has been carrying a significant number of vacancies, resulting in an increased need for planned overtime.\"\nSergeants and constables are eligible to claim overtime for working extra days, for staying on at the end of a shift, or for being recalled between shifts.\nOn four days each week, officers are expected to give the first 30 minutes of unplanned overtime for free, traditionally referred to as \"half an hour for the Queen\".\nThree years ago, Sir Tom Winsor's review of policing in England and Wales called for \"cultural change\" to reduce the cost of overtime.\nHe suggested that in future, the police pay review body may consider a \"buy out\" for sergeants which would see them give up overtime pay in return for an increased salary.\nOvertime for inspectors was \"bought out\" in 1994.\nSouth Wales Police reported the biggest percentage increase for overtime spending in the last year, from £5.2m in 2013/14 to £8.4m in 2014/15.\nThe force said the majority of that increase was due to the Nato summit in September 2014, which involved 9,500 officers from across the UK, including 1,500 from South Wales.\nBut in Scotland and Northern Ireland the figures were down on the previous year.\nPolice Scotland spent £18.2m on overtime in 2014/15, a reduction of £6m on the previous year.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland also spent less, down by £11.5m from £59.2m in 2013/14 to £47.7m in 2014/15.\nA spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: \"Overtime is called upon when it is essential to maintain operational effectiveness and, in the context of capital city policing and national responsibilities, there are times when there is a genuine need to call on officers to work beyond their scheduled hours to police unforeseen events, to provide security, or public reassurance.\"\nThe force said the London Olympic and Paralympic Games had a particular impact on its overtime bill for 2012/13 -

{"id": "33901966", "document": "In English, you either say \"sorry\" or \"apologies\". In Japanese, there are at least 20 different ways.\nOne of the most casual and most frequently used words is \"gomen\" ごめん. You can make it more formal by saying \"gomen-nasai\" ごめんなさい or more friendly with \"gomen-ne\" ごめんね.  \"Warui warui\" 悪い悪い or \"my bad\" is also a very casual way to say sorry.\n\"Sumimasen\" すみません, which can be translated as \"excuse me\", also works as an apology depending on how it is used. \"Yurushite\" 許して is to ask for forgiveness and \"kanben\" 勘弁 can be used to plead for mercy and both terms are used much more casually than in English.\nViewpoint: Why do Japan’s apologies get disregarded?\nMore formal ways to apologise include \"moushiwake nai\" 申し訳ない and \"shazai\" 謝罪. But I use both terms quite often in business emails not because I really feel bad but just to be polite. For example, I may begin my correspondence with \"I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you\" and end it with \"I apologise for creating extra work for you\" even if it only took me a few days to respond and even if I was merely asking them to do what's already in their job description.\nIf I genuinely want to apologise, at least three or four different phrases would appear in one short email. I may be \"too embarrassed to face you\" 合わせる顔がない and \"I have no excuse\" 弁解の余地がない for whatever I did.\nFor the post-war apologies, Japanese leaders have used the word \"hansei\" 反省 much more frequently. In the English transcript, it reads \"remorse\" but I would translate it as \"regret\" and use it, for example, for failing to be more productive on my day off.\nA student would be told to \"hansei\" for forgetting to do one's homework. Its Chinese or Korean equivalents - \"fǎnshè\" or \"banseong\" respectively - also mean \"reflection on\" or \"reconsideration of\" the past.\nThe 1995 statement by former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama was considered landmark because it included the word \"owabi\" お詫び which is one of the most formal ways of apologising. He said his country had caused \"tremendous damage and suffering\" through its \"colonial rule and aggression\" and expressed \"deep remorse\" and stated his \"heartfelt apology\".\nTen years later to mark 60 years since the end of the World War Two, the then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi also used the term \"owabi\". Mr Koizumi's apology, however, was overshadowed by his repeated visits to the controversial Yasukuni shrine where all the war dead - including Class A war criminals - are enshrined.\nThe current Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also included the word \"owabi\" in his war anniversary statement but he had indicated that he would not visit the Yasukuni shrine on Saturday.", "summary": "\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has issued a much-anticipated statement marking the 70th anniversary of the end of World War Two.

If it's not funded better there would actually be fewer children provided for.\n\"I don't think the government has thought through the full implications of that promise.\"\nHe added: \"If we are having to accommodate hundreds of thousands more primary school children in primary schools where are we going to find these nursery places?\"\nHe said: \"Half of our schools say they can't increase the places they offer. The effect will be simply that they don't do it.\"\nNeil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance, said the NAHT's findings reinforced the concerns raised by the private and voluntary childcare sector about the potential impact of the 30 hours offer.\nHe added: \"As the NAHT report highlights, extending funded childcare hours could result not only in increased costs to parents, but also in a shortage of places, as many providers simply do not have the capacity to double the number of funded hours they offer.\n\"It's vital that government resists the temptation to rush out a policy that, while attractive on the surface, is simply unworkable in its current form.\"\nIt comes after a shortfall of places and take-up of the free childcare places for disadvantaged two-year-olds.\nNAHT officials stressed that to double the number of hours that children are catered for is not as simple as doubling the amount of places available.\nCatering facilities, extra rooms, equipment and a much changed range of activities would be required to educate and care for children of this age for a full school day, they said.\nThe Department for Education said: \"Childcare is one of the biggest issues affecting parents. This is why we are working closely with the sector to deliver 30 hours of free childcare, and innovative childcare providers are being asked to come forward as the first in the country to deliver it from September 2016.\n\"We have already committed to raising the average hourly rate providers receive, and are also undertaking a review of childcare costs to inform a new rate that is fair for providers and delivers value for money for the taxpayer.\"", "summary": "\nPlans to extend free childcare places in England's schools could backfire and leave fewer children attending school nurseries, head teachers say.\n\n"}

According to the Gambling Commission, revenue in the UK gambling industry climbed from £5.6bn in 2010 to £7.1bn in 2014.\nBut this disguises the fact that almost all of the growth happened online, with consumers increasingly opting to gamble on mobile devices.\nAs a result, High Street operators face tough trading conditions - a situation worsened by an increasingly challenging regulatory environment, which includes a maximum betting tariff of £50 each time on gaming machines.\nMr Batram says: \"You have new restrictions placed on people who want to stake more than £50 a spin on machines.\n\"Furthermore, machine gaming duties now stand at up to 25%.\n\"And buying land-based assets is quite expensive anyway, because you have bricks and mortar.\"\nHigh Street bookmakers Ladbrokes and Gala Coral joined forces this summer in a bid to offset these pressures. The deal will create the UK's largest bookmaker, with around 4,000 high street betting shops, resulting in a predicted £65m of cost efficiencies.\n\"Ladbrokes has pretty much been running the same business as Coral, but with a different colour and a different brand, \" explains Paul Leyland from Regulus Partners, an advisory business that focuses on the gambling sector.\nHe adds: \"[And] recently Coral has been doing it much better.\"\nMr Leyland says that if the two firms can eliminate duplication costs and stick with the \"best breed of management\", they will be in a stronger position to grow.\nHe also says the combined group needs to invest more in its mobile offering, and boost the overall user experience.\nPaddy Power, a familiar High Street and online betting shop, used it's 2014 annual report to claim that \"over 90% of future growth would be in mobile\".\nAnd so its agreement this summer to combine with website betting exchange Betfair - making them one of the world's biggest online gaming firms - came as little surprise.\nYet despite Paddy Power's optimistic forecast, the online gambling space is becoming more challenging as countries around the world update their regulations.\nFor the online gambling sector, this has resulted in higher compliancy costs and taxes.\nMark Jordan, a partner at accountancy group PWC, highlights the UK's crackdown on gambling websites which have their headquarters in Gibraltar, such as Ladbrokes' online offering, Bet Victor and Stan James.\nHe says: \"Previously if I was headquartered in Gibraltar offering online betting to someone in the UK, that would be tax free, whereas now there is a point of consumption tax which is levied by HMRC at 15%.\"\nMr Batram says such pressures make it harder to invest in the technology underpinning a product.\n\"It's risky given how low the barriers to entry are in online gaming - providers have suddenly realised this comes off their margins, and so you're looking into consolidation and cost savings at scale again.\"\nMr Batram adds: \"Gone are the days when you could just sling up an online casino and watch the money roll in.\n\"The online market is much more competitive, so your site has to feel right, look right and that costs money.\"\nMr Jordan says that private equity companies - which were all but absent from the gambling sector five years ago - are also driving consolidation.\nHe points to last December's announcement that Luxembourg-based private equity group CVC Capital Partners was buying a 80% stake in Sky Bet.\nAnd this month online betting firm Bwin accepted a £1.3bn takeover offer from fellow private equity firm GVC Holdings.\nGVC Holdings, which already owns Sportingbet, outbid rival bidder, gambling business 888 Holdings.\nMr Jordan says: \"Private equity firms like to find a business with potential, build it up and then merge it with something else, so they're having a big influence on the market.\"\nMost analysts expect that consolidation in the gambling sector will only continue as the years progress, with larger conglomerates coming to dominate the industry.\nSuch firms are said to be better placed to handle regulatory and tax pressures.\nHowever, Mr Jordan also expects to see a \"small hardcore of [small] online gaming companies survive, which may not adhere to regulation, or which pick markets where they don't have the same rules\".\nAnd Mr Leyland says that small and specialist gambling companies, focused on niche markets or new products, will also thrive.\nHe adds: \"The big risk is for medium-sized firms with a lot of money, invested in doing exactly the same thing as all their competitors.\"\nWith firms like Paddy Power betting on a digital future, it seems that companies focused on the High Street are most at risk.\nBut Mr Batram says it would be wrong to write them off just yet: \"I think land-based gambling can still offer value if done right, and there's a lot of talk about retail combining with digital to create more touch-points for consumers.\nJust as online hasn't killed cinema or high street shopping, I think it will remain an important part of the mix.\"", "summary": "\nThe UK gambling industry is betting on a wave of mergers and acquisitions to secure a more profitable future.\n\n"}

Within hours, the country's first intervention in the Middle East in decades began.\nMr Putin said Russia was acting \"preventatively, to fight and destroy militants and terrorists on the territories that they already occupy, not wait for them to come to our house\".\nThe Russian defence ministry initially said the first wave of strikes targeted only the jihadist group, Islamic State (IS), which controls large parts of Syria and is fighting both government and rebel forces.\nThe following day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov clarified that the air campaign was targeting \"all terrorists\" in Syria, and not just IS. His ministry said a report by the Syrian Civil Defence rescue organisation of 33 civilian deaths on the first day of the air strikes was \"false\".\nBut the US and its allies noted that the strikes took place where IS had little or no presence. They instead appeared to be aimed at rebels backed by Gulf Arab and Western states who are advancing on Latakia province - the coastal heartland of Mr Assad's Alawite sect. At least one group that has been armed and trained by the CIA was hit, US officials said.\nRussia has made clear that its intervention was approved by Mr Assad, who sent a letter to Mr Putin requesting military assistance. Mr Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the targets were chosen \"in co-ordination\" with Syrian forces.\nSyrian state media has strongly endorsed the air strikes on 30 September, and there were reports of celebrations by government supporters in Latakia. \"They're all terrorists,\" Saleh al-Tartousi, an import contractor, told the Guardian. \"They should not be spared mercy.\"\nBut opposition activists and rebel fighters have expressed alarm. \"If these raids continue this way, Russia will kill a larger number of civilians that Bashar did in four years,\" Khoodair Khusheif, an activist in northern Homs province, told the New York Times.\nRussia's president has said he still believes only a political solution can end the conflict in Syria, but some fear its intervention makes the prospect of a negotiated settlement more remote.\n\"By supporting Assad and seemingly taking on everyone who is fighting Assad, you're taking on the whole rest of the country of Syria,\" US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter said after learning that rebel-held areas had been targeted.\n\"At least some parts of the anti-Assad opposition belong in the political transition going forward. That's why... the Russian approach is doomed to fail.\"\nHe went on to warn that Russia \"risks escalating the civil war in Syria - and with it, the very extremism and instability that Moscow claims to be concerned about\". \"That approach is tantamountâ€¦ to pouring gasoline on the fire,\" he added.\nThe Russian president is one of Mr Assad's most important international backers.\nTies between their countries go back four decades and the Syrian port of Tartous is the location of the last Russian naval base in the Middle East. Russia has blocked several resolutions critical of Mr Assad at the UN Security Council and supplied weapons to the Syrian military, saying it is violating no international laws.\nWith Syrian government forces suffering a string of defeats to both rebel forces and IS over the past year, Mr Putin decided to intervene. In early September, Russian warplanes, attack helicopters, tanks, anti-aircraft systems and hundreds of marines arrived at a base in Latakia province.\nRussian officials have reportedly said they are not intent on keeping Mr Assad in power, but they see his government as a bulwark against IS, which controls large parts of northern and eastern Syria.\nAsked in an interview with CBS if his goal was \"trying to save the Assad administration\", Mr Putin replied: \"You're right.\"\nRussia's deployment of air-to-air fighter aircraft and air-defence systems in Latakia suggests it may be preparing to do more than just carry out air strikes on IS and protect its base at Tartous.\nNato's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Gen Philip Breedlove, warned on 28 September that Russia was developing an anti-aircraft \"bubble\" in the eastern Mediterranean. \"These very sophisticated air-defence capabilities are not about [IS],\" he said.\n\"High on Mr Putin's list in Syria is preserving the regime against those that are putting pressure on the regime, and against those that they see who might be supporting those putting pressure on the regime,\" the general added.\nRussia might even attempt to impose a no-fly zone that would prevent air strikes by the US-led coalition against IS, many of whose member states back the rebels.

The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\nMr Netanyahu also berated Mr Abbas for what he called inciting violence and telling lies about Israel seeking to change the status quo at a holy compound in East Jerusalem, known to Jews as Temple Mount and Muslims as Haram al-Sharif.\nMahmoud Abbas on Wednesday accused Israel of using excessive force against Palestinians.\nHe said Israel was carrying out \"executions of our children in cold blood\", highlighting the case of a 13-year-old Palestinian boy, Ahmed Manasra, who was hit by a car after he and a 15-year-old stabbed two Israelis, one of them a 13-year-old boy, on Monday.\nMr Netanyahu rejected this as a \"new big lie\" in his news conference on Thursday, hours after his government released video and photos showing the boy alive in an Israeli hospital.\nSenior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat later said that Mr Abbas had received inaccurate information on the boy's condition, AFP news agency reports.\nIsraeli police on Wednesday began setting up checkpoints in Arab-majority parts of East Jerusalem, including one neighbourhood that was home to three of the Palestinians who carried out attacks on Israelis this week.\nIsrael's security cabinet had earlier authorised police to seal off or impose a curfew on parts of the city in a bid to stop \"those who try murder and...all those who assist them\".\nIt also announced that the homes of Palestinian attackers would be demolished within days and that their families' right to live in Jerusalem would be taken away.\nThe Palestinian leader said on Wednesday that Israel's security actions threatened \"to spark a religious conflict that would burn everything\".\nHuman Rights Watch has also condemned the new measures, saying they infringed on freedom of movement of all Palestinians.\nBut Mr Netanyahu defended Israel's actions, saying it was using legitimate force.

The attackers have struck in Jerusalem and central and northern Israel, and in the occupied West Bank. Israel has tightened security and its security forces have clashed with rioting Palestinians, leading to deaths on the Palestinian side. The violence has also spread to the border with Gaza.\nAfter a period of relative quiet, violence between the two communities has spiralled since clashes erupted at a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site in mid-September. It was fuelled by rumours among Palestinians that Israel was attempting to alter a long-standing religious arrangement governing the site. Israel repeatedly dismissed the rumours as incitement. Soon afterwards, two Israelis were shot dead by Palestinians in the West Bank and the stabbing attacks began. Both Israel and the Palestinian authorities have accused one another of doing nothing to protect each other's communities.\nThere have been two organised uprisings by Palestinians against Israeli occupation, in the 1980s and early 2000s.

The idea that commuting was going to get better resonated strongly with people,\" says Richard Nimijean, a professor in Canadian studies at Ottawa's Carleton University.\nHarper seemed to exaggerate how well Canada rode out the global downturn, he adds, whereas Mr Trudeau focused on how many people felt - like their wages were stagnant and the housing market out of reach.\nThe Conservative leader took a hard line on taking Syrian refugees and opposed the wearing of the niqab by Muslims at citizenship ceremonies.\nWhile there was sizable support for him in both these issues, the tipping point came soon after the niqab furore when he pledged to set up a police hotline to report \"barbaric cultural practices\".\n\"That's where it crossed the line and people - especially on social media - said it was too much,\" Mr Nimijean says. \"There's a fine line between being cautious and conservative and being mean.\n\"Then along comes Trudeau talking about positive values and people thought 'This is where I want to park my vote.'\"\nBill C51, which strengthened government powers of surveillance after a series of shootings targeting the government in 2014, rallied many against what they felt was an attack on civil liberties.\nIf the election had happened earlier in the year, Bill C51 might have been an even bigger issue in the campaign.

The death toll was an almost unbelievable zero.\nThe hurricane's path changed and in the end hit a relatively unpopulated part of the coast, avoiding the tourist resort of Puerto Vallarta and the busy port of Manzanillo, before heading into the mountains.\nInevitably, once danger had passed, the jokes started appearing.\nOne went like this: As soon as Hurricane Patricia entered Mexico, it was robbed of five categories - typical Mexicans!\nAnd then there were the accusations that this was all just a storm in a teacup - that President Enrique Pena Nieto had exaggerated the potential catastrophe to make himself look good.\nBut even amid the teasing, for the first time in a long time, there was far more praise than criticism of Mr Pena Nieto's administration who's faced low approval ratings for quite some time.\nPatricia hits Mexico: Key questions\nAfter the storm: Clean-up begins\nBBC Earth explains: What is a hurricane?\nFrom the very start, as Patricia's winds started intensifying, television and radio bulletins warned people of the incoming storm. President Pena Nieto was on the television and radio.\nHe and every other government agency, it seemed, were tweeting about the coordinated effort between federal and state governments and warning people to get away from the coast.\nIn the end, catastrophe was averted. Mr Pena Nieto said that the shock of the hurricane had \"brought together all Mexicans\".\n\"The fact that there were no deaths was mostly down to the faith of the Mexican people,\" he said.\nBut experts have a different explanation.\n\"The federal government was effective in orchestrating the preventive measures in the build-up,\" says Lourdes Pintado of Control Risks in Mexico City, who said the co-ordination between state and federal agencies worked well.\n\"The strategy focused on setting up shelters, supplying security personnel and communicating both the level of the threat and the preventive measures to the individuals on the coastal areas that were most vulnerable,\" she says.\n\"They got lucky,\" says Prof Richard Olson, the director of the Extreme Events Institute at Florida International University in Miami.\n\"But they also have a reasonably strong civil protection system and so in this kind of an emergency and in this kind of event they are going to look pretty good.\"\nLourdes Pintado thinks lessons have been learned - last year when Hurricane Odile hit Baja California, co-ordination between state and federal government was stronger after the hurricane than before. That hurricane also had a higher death toll.\nFor Prof Olson those lessons go back much further and date back to 1985 when Mexico City was hit by a massive earthquake that left at least 9,000 people dead and 30,000 injured.\n\"The entire Mexican system will never forget 1985 and how bad that made the entire PRI regime look,\" he said, referring to the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) which was in power at the time.\n\"After that, they really worked hard to build up from the municipal to the national level and a pretty robust system so that nobody would look that bad ever again.\"\nWhile the government can be pleased with the outcome, every hurricane is different and this could have turned out very differently had the hurricane continued on its path to a major city or had there been major flooding.\nAround 80% of hurricane deaths are caused by water, according to Prof Olson.\n\"The key is we have to keep this success in perspective because every event is a test,\" he says.\n\"They look pretty good on this one but I can run you an alternate scenario where this one could have been a disaster not just an emergency.\"", "summary": "\nAs Hurricane Patricia bore down on Mexico last week people became very nervous.\n\n"}

{"id": "34701607", "document": "Smash hits performed by Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley in the forties or fifties, or Rihanna and Justin Bieber today, were often penned by professionals.\nEven internationally-acclaimed singer Adele, whose new album, 25, comes out today, and whose last - 21 - sold more than 30 million copies, co-writes her material.\nNot that record labels like to crow about songwriters - most of these hired guns are virtually unknown outside the industry.\nBut are these powers behind the throne seeing their livelihoods threatened by music videos and digital streaming?\nMany fear so.\nWhat all professional songwriters have in common is a publishing deal, and like the recorded music industry, music publishing is worth billions globally.\nBut the switch to buying and listening to music in digital rather than physical form has dented revenues, and not just because of piracy - file-sharing that infringes copyright.\nJane Dyball, chief executive of the Music Publishers Association (MPA), says that while streaming is not a bad thing in itself, there are concerns about whether the advertising revenue generated by platforms such as YouTube and Spotify is sufficient to ensure fair returns to writers as well as to artists and record companies.\n\"Someone suggested they should be called music-supported advertising services rather than advertising-supported music services,\" Ms Dyball quips.\nIf a song is streamed a million times, there should be one million payments in return, Ms Dyball says - a concept the industry calls \"pay per play\".\nThat is similar to Spotify's business model, but not that of YouTube, which gathers the revenue generated by advertising into a pool and then distributes it to rights holders.\nThe problem is, critics say, YouTube is parsimonious in the extreme.\n\"It's now time for YouTube to show that it is going to generate revenue back to the industry that reflects the amount of music its users consume,\" says Ms Dyball.\nIf you can get music for free via YouTube, why pay for subscription services such as Spotify - which now has 20 million paying users - or Apple Music - which has 6.5 million paying subscribers?\nThere is also disquiet about SoundCloud, a German music streaming platform. The industry body PRS for Music - which collects royalties for more than 111,000 songwriters, composers and music publishers - says it lacks a licence to play music in the UK and is taking legal action against Soundcloud for unpaid royalties.\nMark Lawrence, chief executive of the Association for Electronic Music, told Music Business Worldwide he hopes it will mean that \"one writer and/or one artist getting one play can be confident of earning one payment, however small\".\nRobert Ashcroft, chief executive of PRS for Music, says times are good for successful artists who write their own material - like Ed Sheeran - but believes things are more difficult for less well-known writers.\nWith album sales dwindling in favour of individual song downloads, budding songwriters have to hope their songs are streamed by music fans in the face of competition from the millions already available.\nAnd the royalties earned from streaming can be minuscule.\nKevin Kadish, co-writer of the Meghan Trainor smash hit, All About That Bass, says he earned just $5,679 from 178 million streams of the song. The video has been watched more than 1.1 billion times on YouTube.\nSinger Taylor Swift successfully forced Apple Music to reverse policy and pay artists for music streamed during trial periods of its music service, saying it was \"unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing\".\nMr Ashcroft says that paid-for streaming can be a viable replacement for downloads, but only if the problem of under-licensed - by which he means YouTube - and un-licensed platforms - Soundcloud - can be addressed.\n\"Spotify is not the problem - the problem is that the legal playing field is not level,\" he says.\nMeanwhile the music publishing business seems to be stalling.\nThe world's biggest music publisher is Sony/ATV, which also owns the EMI publishing business and the rights to the Beatles' back catalogue, had revenues of about $660m (Â£435m) in the first half of 2015 - a sum as high as the combined turnover of rivals Universal Music Publishing and Warner/Chappell.\nDespite this, Sony, which has co-owned the publishing joint venture with the estate of Michael Jackson since 1995, wants to sell its stake.\nIn a leaked email, Sony chief financial officer, Kenichiro Yoshida, wrote that the publishing business is complex and \"is impacted by the market shift to streaming\".\nEven when songwriters do generate some income from their tunes, they can often wait up to two years for payment, as antiquated systems struggle to cope in the digital age - PRS says the number of individual music plays has risen from 15 million a year five years ago to one trillion.\nPRS is now part of a new pan-European licensing system called ICE that will more accurately match songwriters, composers and publishers of pieces of music to ensure rights holders get paid more speedily - describing it the biggest revolution in the history of music copyright.\nThe world of music will always need songwriters, but until the economics of the industry are recalibrated fairly for the digital age, their songs may struggle to be heard.", "summary": "\nSongwriters have played a crucial part in the success of many global superstars throughout the history of popular music.\n\n"}

This has also been factor in pushing down the price of oil to 11-year lows.\nIn its World Oil Outlook report, Opec said it expected supply growth from US shale to slow dramatically next year, as producers struggled to cope with such low prices.\nOpec's strategy this year has been to allow prices to fall by maintaining production in the hope that, eventually, US shale producers will be forced out of business.\nAnother factor in low prices, Opec said, was weaker economic growth, particularly in developing economies. It highlighted China, where the \"economy seems to be maturing and growth is decelerating faster than previously expected\".\nThe report also highlighted the \"huge reductions\" in spending on exploration and production by the industry as a whole due to low oil prices.\nThese cutbacks will ultimately see supply fall, it said, putting upward pressure on prices.\nAnother longer-term factor pushing prices up, Opec said, was higher exploration costs, as companies are forced to look harder for oil as traditional supply sources dwindle. Deep water drilling, for example, is considerably more expensive than drilling onshore.\nFinally, Opec said population and economic growth would see demand for energy rise by almost a half by 2040, increasing demand for oil.\nOpec was founded in 1960 by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.\nThese countries have since been joined by Qatar (1961), Indonesia (1962), Libya (1962), the United Arab Emirates (1967), Algeria (1969), Nigeria (1971), Ecuador (1973), Gabon (1975) and Angola (2007).", "summary": "\nOil producers' group Opec has said it expects oil prices to recover to $70 a barrel by 2020.\n\n"}

Despite everything - the latest blow being a $20bn (Â£13bn) lawsuit from the US government - he appeared surprisingly optimistic on his corporate naughty step.\nWhile acknowledging that some very serious things had gone wrong, customers had been let down, and things had to be \"cleaned up\", he was confident in his company's long-term future.\n\"There will be a slight short-term reaction in markets. A little insecurity. In long run no impact,\" he says.\nI sensed Mr Stadler was keen to create some clear blue water between his premium, high-margin Audi brand and the VW mothership.\nNeither did he think the good name of \"made in Germany\", the premium that can be added to manufactured goods made in that country, would be affected by the reputational fallout.\n\"All those comments are exaggerated. I'm absolutely convinced 'made in Germany' still has a high value.\"\nAt the other end of the trust scale sits the British John Lewis Partnership comprising the John Lewis department stores and the Waitrose supermarkets.\nIts chairman Charlie Mayfield says: \"I think trust means three things. Firstly, act in the customer's interests.\n\"Secondly, make sure you always do as you say you will, and thirdly, if something goes wrong - admit it and then deal with the problem.\"\nThis combination of honesty, integrity and transparency is no bad yardstick.\n\"You get a 'trust deficit' when an inherent conflict arises between the making of profit and the interests of the consumer,\" says Mr Mayfield.\n\"At the extreme these two can be in opposition.

I'm not sure this is true.\nWas there ever a golden age of trust? The Victorian era when robber barons ruled the land, and children were put up chimneys and down mines, and Charles Dickens laboured in a boot-blacking factory aged 12?\nThe 1920s and 1930s were decades of bitter strikes, worker lock-outs, and compulsory wage cuts. In recent decades we had Robert Maxwell, Polly Peck, and Enron.\nWhat is true, however, is that mistrust of business is mostly confined to large companies. It's unusual for people to feel so hostile towards business in their local communities - indeed, if they did these small and medium-sized firms would be unlikely to survive.\nThere's something about the size that comes with success and growth that engenders trouble on the trust front.\nMaintaining clear purpose, engagement among your staff, and your integrity, is undoubtedly far harder once the boss no longer knows everyone.\nComing back to VW - the group has a long way to go to rebuild its reputation.\nWho remembers the classic TV commercial for the Volkswagen Golf from the 1980s, when the model Paula Hamilton leaves her boyfriend, discards her fur coat and ring as she leaves the house, before stepping into her Golf?\nThe tagline at the end was - \"If only everything in life was as reliable as a Volkswagen\".\nYou can hear Matthew Gywther's episode of In Business - the Business of Trust - at 20:30 GMT on Thurs, 7 Jan 2016 and again at 21:30 GMT on Sun, 10 Jan 2016 on BBC Radio 4.

The group has set up its own \"police force\" and is reported to be carrying out house to house searches and forcing people to attend Islamic re-education classes.\nThe head of intelligence in nearby Misrata says most of the IS fighters who control Sirte are foreigners - from Tunisia, Iraq or Syria.\nAccess to the city is dangerous for journalists and there is limited communication with people who live there - often for fear of retributions. We spoke to people who have been forced to leave the city, to escape Islamic State.\nWarning: You may find some of the content below disturbing\nI was a children's doctor at the Ibn Sina Hospital. I'm now in Tripoli having escaped with my immediate family back in August 2015 when clashes were starting. But of course like others, we have relatives still inside. We sometimes contact them via the internet thanks to a satellite connection. But more widely, there's no internet or phone lines available.\nThose who remain in the city tend to be the less well-off ones who can't afford rent in other cities. We have also been told about the lack of medicines at hospitals. Those with life-threatening conditions who can get out, are getting out.\nThe killing is unbelievable. I lost four cousins on my father's side, five cousins on my mother's side, three other relatives and two neighbours.\nOne cousin was crucified at the Zaafran roundabout.\nAnother cousin was killed at the Gharbiyat roundabout and a third was beheaded.\nThe fourth was killed with a tank missile. My friend lost three of her young brothers.\nMy friend, who also left Sirte, settled in Zliten recently. But the situation there is tragic. Her brother was killed in an explosion, the suicide attack on 7 January. He was about to graduate at the military school. An occasion of happiness was turned into one of mourning.\nIslamic State has taken over key locations in Sirte\nImage: Copernicus Sentinel-2/ESA image captured on 29 November 2015\nI blame regional countries for IS. I hate hearing names of certain countries now: Egypt, Tunisia, Qatar, Algeria, Sudan, Afghanistan, Syria. We Libyans, would have sorted our problems by ourselves if they had left us alone.\nThere are Libyans amongst them (Islamic State) like the Benghazi and Derna jihadists. Libya is a small place, we all know each other.\nMy dad is a senior policeman and was getting threats in Sirte. Anyone who works with the police can be kidnapped or killed unless you join them.\nDaesh forces (IS) are mainly in the city centre. A friend tells me they took over our empty house as well as the main government buildings like council buildings, the hospital I used to work at, the local mosque and the university.\nI left Sirte back in early December. Islamic State fighters took over the city in February 2015. It wasn't an invasion per se. It was a combination of local jihadi fighters (Ansar Al-Sharia) declaring their allegiance to the Islamic State group and later being joined by fighters fleeing or beaten by the forces of General Khalifa Haftar in Benghazi.\nThere are also other nationalities in the ranks of IS that we either noticed from their accents or looks. They included Tunisians and Egyptians. They were not just Arabs. In April 2015, there was a special parade welcoming people they said were Boko Haram fighters from Nigeria.\nIS was quite laid back at the start in terms of implementing their harsh interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. You get the feeling that they were focussing on building loyalty and allegiances from the tribal society of Sirte.\nIt was only in August when Islamic codes of dress and behaviour began to be implemented more noticeably. It was also then when crucifixions and lashings began to be meted out to anyone convicted. These usually take place after Friday prayers.\nUntil I left in December with my family, going in to and leaving the city was quite routine. The only people experiencing problems when it comes to their freedom of movement is anyone associated with other fighting groups or suspected of being a \"spy\".\nMost foods and items at the shops are slightly more expensive. But there hasn't been any petrol available for a year and a half. People who still receive their public sector salaries from Tripoli choose to stay. Leaving simply does not make economic sense for most people.\nLeaflets and letters have been distributed to shopkeepers and public sector workers inviting them to \"re-education\" courses run by Islamic State.\nIS have their command centre next to the domed, marble-clad Ougadougou Conference Centre - built by Muammar Gaddafi to host pan-African summits.\nThe centre is now used for courses where IS members instruct employees in the importance of adhering to their version of Islamic law.\nThe letters warn: \"Whoever does not attend will be liable to questioning.\"\nI'm originally from Sirte. I was self-employed but I left the city with my family on 17 July last year, some time after the arrival of IS.\nI was of course also scared for my family. We still have relatives and friends inside the city. We now live in Misrata.\nWhen we escaped, they left people alone to come and go as they please. I'm hearing from friends people can still leave if they wish to.\nWe're also hearing that medicines at hospitals are almost non-existent. Food is available, but via 'war profiteers'.  As far as we know, there's no petrol left.\nThey must have taken the city with the help of pro-Gaddafi people. The pro-Gaddafi lot came in initially under the pretext of kicking out the Misrata fighters from Sirte.  There's no way these foreign IS fighters would have known their way around the city without help from locals. The city is tribal and loyalties are divided.\nThey started crucifying people at entrance to the city two months into their rule. Their \"crime\" was being spies for \"Libya Dawn\" fighters. The location of the crucifixion is at the entrance to the city.\nI saw at least one myself being crucified. Later, I heard and read about 17 more, including my friend Sharaf Aldeen and his brother (the salafi cleric) sheikh Meftah Abu Sittah. Both were killed then crucified.\nBillboards instructing women how to dress according to Sharia were erected in Sirte in July 2015. The poster reads:\nInstructions on wearing the hijab according to Sharia\n1. It must be thick and not revealing\n2. It must be loose (not tight)\n3. It must cover all the body\n4. It must not be attractive\n5. It must not resemble the clothes of unbelievers or men\n6. It must not be decorative and eye-catching\n7. It must not be perfumed.\nI'm originally from Ras Lanuf and have studied at university in Sirte.\nI'm now in Sidra (174km east of Sirte) where I work and where Daesh are trying to take over the oil port but the Petroleum Facilities Guards have so far repelled their advances. Their last major attempt was on 4 January. They set off a car bomb at the gate just outside the port where the guards where stationed.\nAt least seven guards and several IS members were killed. IS later went round us at Sidra to make their way to Ras Lanuf, 15km away. They took over a military area between Ras Lanuf and the industrial zone.\nDaesh attacks have never stopped. They know they don't have the resources to overpower the oil port. So they're resorting to hit and run tactics, including setting fuel containers on fire. Their very last attack was on Saturday (30 January).\nWe're not living in a state of full war, yet it's not completely peaceful. People are trying to live some sort of normal life. That's why schools have reopened after they were closed at the start of January.\nI was in Sirte myself in late December. I still have friends there. Communication is hard because lines have been cut. Those who left went out through the west of the city towards Misrata.\nThe route is open and safe that way. Eastwards towards the Sidra oil port, for example, is dangerous as there's still clashes. I know local fighters from Ras Lanuf are preparing a counter attack on Sirte.\nLibya was thrown into chaos after Nato-backed forces overthrew its long-serving ruler, Gaddafi in 2011.\nElections were held in 2014, but those who held power in Tripoli refused to give it up, another rival faction set up its own parliament elsewhere and other armed groups have been fighting for control of cities and what remains of the country's infrastructure.\nThe Islamic State group is estimated to have no more than 2,000 to 3,000 fighters across the country, according to a United Nations report published in December 2015. Their fighters are mainly split between Derna and Sirte - with around 1,500 of them in Sirte - where they have taken control of the state-run radio station and broadcast speeches by IS religious leaders.\nThe Head of Intelligence in nearby Misrata, Ismail Shukri, says most of the IS fighters are foreign. Although the majority are from Tunisia, he says senior IS figures from Iraq and Syria are also taking refuge in Libya.\nIS numbers in the capital, Tripoli, are believed to be marginal - with only 12 to 24 operating as a cell in the city, the report suggests. However, they have been able to carry out high-level attacks, including a strike on the Corinthia Hotel in January 2015, which left eight people dead, and an assault on a prison inside Tripoli's Mitiga airbase in September.\nIS militants having been trying to push eastwards from Sirte and have carried out a number of attacks on the oil facilities at Sidra and Ras Lanuf since the start of January 2016.\nProduced by Dominic Bailey and Abdirahim Saeed\nSome of the images used in this article showing life in Sirte were first published on social media by the local affiliate of the Islamic State group.

He will go away happy and we will see a progression on what they did against Scotland over the next few games.\nThe tactics were more route one, using the forwards. Centre Jonathan Joseph didn't really get the ball and the wingers mainly got it from kick returns so there is still a bit of finesse for England to put around the back line.\nThe stats showed that England's set-piece was very good.\nCaptain Dylan Hartley's line-outs were brilliant (England only lost one of their 15) and they were clinical.\nJones has said he wants a strong set-piece game and he wants a strong, abrasive pack. They delivered that against Scotland.\nEngland also probably had two clear-cut chances to score tries and they took both of them.\nFrom that side it is all positives but I think Joseph will want to be in the game more.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHis centre partner Owen Farrell wasn't in the game that much either and full-back Mike Brown wasn't his usual self. That will come but it is just going to take a bit of time.\nI am not massively sold on the combination of Owen Farrell and George Ford at fly-half and inside centre. If you have two number 10s who are out-and-out number 10s then both of them are spending too much time organising the game rather than carrying the ball.\nFarrell only carried the ball three times against Scotland and Joseph four. The midfield is not really functioning properly if that is happening. But at the same time, they linked up beautifully to put Jack Nowell in for a try.\nI would prefer an out-and-out inside centre who can also be a ball player rather than a fly-half playing there. At the moment it is a stop gap for England.\nI would prefer someone with a little bit more individual threat who can also do the distributing. Someone who is saying, \"I need to be in the game more\". Sometimes Farrell is trying to plan what England do and plot them around the pitch. George Ford needs to be doing that.\nHenry Slade is your dream but he is injured. He would have been the answer without a question of a doubt. At the moment they are having to do what they can with limited resources.\nEngland edged the breakdown in terms of numbers and in terms of actual turnovers.\nThere are a lot of people in the England pack that can make turnovers with Dan Cole, Chris Robshaw, Joe Launchbury, James Haskell, Billy Vunipola and Mako Vunipola off the bench.\nI do hope England don't come up against an out-and-out specialist open-side flanker and get done again. We are not going to see that probably until we go to play Australia in the summer but it will be interesting to see what England do in the meantime.\nWe still need to develop an out-and-out number seven. It will strengthen our game but someone has got to play well enough to keep knocking on the door.\nI judge intensity on the speed of your ball coming out from rucks and how fast people are getting into position to carry again.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nEngland completely outworked Scotland in that respect. I also judge intensity on what a side does in defence - in terms of line speed in getting up to make a tackle.\nIn the first half England were a bit off it but in the second half they were outstanding. They really led the line and outworked Scotland. From that point of view I think Eddie will be very happy.\nThe scorelines might be similar between England's first game under Stuart Lancaster at Murrayfield in 2012 (a 13-6 victory) and this weekend but England had a lot more control this weekend.\nAt the same time it can't really be compared. Stuart was creating a brand new team. He got rid of all the old guys and brought in loads of youngsters. Jones' team knew each other very well.\nI would give it a solid six and a half out of 10. Maybe a seven. There is still a lot of work to be done but knowing Jones and the workaholic nature he has got, he'll think the same.", "summary": "\nIn terms of what England wanted out of the game with Scotland I think they got everything.\n\n"}

At first the cardinal's letters were formal, but as their friendship grew, they become more intimate.\nThe pair decided to work on an expanded version of the cardinal's book, The Acting Person. They met many times - sometimes with his secretary present, sometimes alone - and corresponded frequently.\nIn 1974, he wrote that he was re-reading four of Ms Tymieniecka's letters written in one month because they were \"so meaningful and deeply personal\".\nPhotographs which have never been seen before by the public reveal Karol Wojtyla at his most relaxed. He invited Ms Tymieniecka to join him on country walks and skiing holidays - she even joined him on a group camping trip.

Ms Tymieniecka invited him to stay with her family at their country home in New England.\nShe appeared to have revealed intense feelings for him because his letters immediately afterwards suggest a man struggling to make sense of their friendship in Christian terms.\nIn one, dated September 1976, he writes: \"My dear Teresa, I have received all three letters. You write about being torn apart, but I could find no answer to these words.\"\nHe describes her as a \"gift from God\".\nThe BBC has not seen any of Ms Tymieniecka's letters. It is believed copies of them were included in the archive that was sold to the Polish National Library by Ms Tymieniecka in 2008, six years before she died. But they were not with the Pope's letters when the BBC was shown them. The National Library of Poland has not confirmed that they have Ms Tymieniecka's letters.\nMarsha Malinowski, a rare manuscripts dealer who negotiated the sale of the letters, says she believes Ms Tymieniecka fell in love with Cardinal Wojtyla in the early days of their relationship. \"I think that it's completely reflected in the correspondence,\" she told the BBC.\nThe letters reveal that Cardinal Wojtyla gave Ms Tymieniecka one of his most treasured possessions, an item known as a scapular - a small devotional necklace worn around the shoulders.\nLife of John Paul\nHow does someone become a saint?\nIn a letter dated 10 September 1976 he wrote: \"Already last year I was looking for an answer to these words, 'I belong to you', and finally, before leaving Poland, I found a way - a scapular. The dimension in which I accept and feel you everywhere in all kinds of situations, when you are close, and when you are far away.\"\nAfter becoming Pope he wrote: \"I am writing after the event, so that the correspondence between us should continue. I promise I will remember everything at this new stage of my journey.\"\nCardinal Wojtyla had a number of female friends, including Wanda Poltawska, a psychiatrist with whom he also corresponded for decades.\nBut his letters to Ms Tymieniecka are at times more intensely emotional, sometimes wrestling with the meaning of their relationship.\nPope John Paul II died in 2005, after an almost 27-year reign. In 2014 he was declared a saint.\nThe process of saint-making is usually long and very costly, but John Paul II was fast-tracked to sainthood in just nine years.\nNormally the Vatican asks to see all public and private writings when considering a candidate for sainthood, but the BBC has not been able to confirm whether the letters were seen.\nThe Congregation for the Causes of Saints said it is up to individual Catholics to decide whether to send in documents.\n\"All our duties were done,\" it told the BBC in a statement. \"All private documents, sent by faithful as a response to the edict, and documents found in important archives were studied.\"\nThe National Library of Poland disputes that this was a unique relationship.

{"id": "35656150", "document": "That dismal description comes from the country's own Finance Minister, Alexander Stubb.\nNew figures for the economy's performance in 2015, showed that it managed to avoid a fourth consecutive year of declining economic activity. Even so, it was very lacklustre growth and the longer picture remains pretty bleak.\nThe broadest measure of that, GDP, is still about 7% below the high it reached at the end of 2007, just before the global financial crisis.\nMost, though not all, eurozone countries have got back to those earlier levels and a bit above.  Even one country that was bailed out, Ireland, is among those relatively strong performers.\nFinland's disappointing performance has also shown up in the unemployment figures, which rose from 6.2% of the workforce in early 2008 to 9.5% in the most recent figures.\nSo who is to blame?\nThe slightly flippant answer is: the late Steve Jobs, founder of Apple. But there is a serious point behind that - well two actually, although it's not the whole story of Finland's economic troubles.\nIn 2014 Mr Stubb, who was the prime minister at the time, told a newspaper that: \"Steve Jobs took our jobs.\"\nNot literally of course. What he meant was that Apple products had created serious challenges for two very important Finnish industries.\nOne was forestry - in particular, paper. It's a huge industry with a long history in Finland.  The country's extensive forests are not just pretty; they are a very valuable commercial resource.\nBut Finland has been affected by what an independent economic research agency in Helsinki (ETLA) called \"the reduction of demand for print paper due to the substitution of print media by internet services\".  It's not just Apple's doing of course, but the company is a key player in that development.\nFinland's other Apple-related casualty is Nokia, which incidentally began life as a paper producer in the 19th Century.\nNokia branched out and eventually became the world's biggest supplier of mobile phone handsets. But it failed to respond to the challenge presented by Apple's iPhone and  other smartphones.\nIt's just one company, but a huge one that overshadowed a small economy. According to the ETLA report: \"Its direct contribution accounts for 1/3 of the GDP decline and its shedding of employment for 1/5 of the reduction of total employment between 2008 and 2014.\"\nThe impact is even bigger if you include the wider technology sector of which Nokia is a part.\nSo there you have it. Finland's economic troubles are due to Steve Jobs and the business he created.\nWell, no. There have been a few other things going on too.\nRead more: Finland country profile\nListen: Business Daily: Finland's long economic winter\nThere has been another external problem, this one supplied by one of Finland's neighbours, Russia. Not for the first time, trouble across the eastern border has made itself felt in the domestic Finnish economy.\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s hit Finnish exports. So have the more recent problems in Russia, which were the result of lower oil prices and Western sanctions related to the crisis in Ukraine. Russia's trade retaliation against the EU has also hit Finland, as it banned some EU imports.  To take one example, for the country's leading dairy business, Valio, that was a serious blow.\nThere are other issues that can't be blamed on bad luck descending from overseas. The population is ageing. That means a lower proportion of the population is working, generating wealth and paying income taxes.\nThere is also an issue with competitiveness. One measure is known as unit labour costs. According to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, that rose by 25% between 2007 (just before the crisis) and 2014.\nWages continued to rise after the crisis while productivity, the amount produced by each worker, declined.\nThe government is seeking to tackle these issues with a range of reforms to business, benefits and employment intended to reduce labour costs.\nA related issue is the very large share of state spending in Finnish GDP - the largest in the OECD (which is made up mainly of rich countries). That partly reflects increased spending due to higher unemployment and an older population.  It also means taxes are relatively high.\nThe government's strategy for addressing competitiveness is sometimes called \"internal devaluation\", which means in essence taking steps to reduce costs for business.  It's an alternative to devaluing the national currency to improve competitiveness, an option that is not available because Finland uses the euro.\nIt was widely recognised that one potential risk of a currency union was the loss of a flexible currency to respond to economic developments that affect different members differently - sometimes called idiosyncratic or asymmetric shocks.\nSo would Finland's economic problems have been any milder if there had been a national currency to devalue?\nPerhaps.  Exchange rates are determined by financial markets, but it is certainly possible that bad news about the economy would have weakened the currency and given something of a boost to competitiveness.\nThe ETLA report suggested things might have been different: \"The weakness of growth in Finland can best be explained by a series of exceptional negative shocks in combination with a too weak capacity of the economy to improve its cost competitiveness in the absence of exchange rate flexibility.\"\nIt's a nuanced report. The conclusions of Tuomas Mallinen, an economist at Helsinki University, are more stark: \"The main blame on our economic woes should be placed where it belongs, namely on the euro membership.\"\nThis view is rejected by the governor of the Bank of Finland, Erkki Liikanen, who sits on the European Central Bank committee that makes monetary policy decisions.\nHe told the Daily Telegraph: \"If we had a little weaker Finnish markka (the national currency before the introduction of the euro), I wouldn't believe that Nokia would beat iPhones or that young people would suddenly start to read printed books and newspapers, thus creating demand for the products of Finnish paper mills. Our challenges are based on structural facts. An adjustment of our currency would not make up for those challenges.\"\nFinland continues to struggle with a battery of forces that have hit its economy since the international crisis.\nStill, it's worth recalling that, as the OECD said in a recent assessment, \"Finland enjoys a high level of income and well-being\" and despite the rise in unemployment \"social safety nets keep income inequality low\".\nIt's just that if Finland had adjusted better to all the shocks, incomes would probably be quite a bit higher.", "summary": "\nIs Finland now officially \"the sick man of Europe\"?\n\n"}

She is still laying one or two eggs per day, and they need something like 120 days till they hatch.\"\nThat is an uncertain estimate, he explained, based on a colony of olms that was established in the 1950s in an underground lab in the French Pyrenees. There, they live in slightly warmer water, at 11C.\n\"In our cave, it is slightly cooler, 9C, so everything will be prolonged.\"\nIt is a unique opportunity to observe the enigmatic olm - also known as the proteus - reproducing in the same caves where it has lived for millions of years.\n\"It is very significant because there is not a lot of data about anything, [relating to] the reproduction of this group of animals,\" commented Dusan Jelic, a Zoological Society of London Edge Fellow who studies wild olms by diving underwater through cave systems in Croatia.\nIf the baby olms hatch and develop healthily, Dr Jelic said, it would be \"something amazing\".\n\"In the wild, we never find eggs or larvae. They are probably hidden within some very specific localities within the cave systems.\"\nThere is just such a labyrinthine cave system in Postojna, with its own population of wild olms - but remarkably, this particular clutch of eggs has been laid in an aquarium in the cave's heavily trafficked visitor area.\n\"This is very cool - it is quite extraordinary,\" said Primoz Gnezda, another biologist working at Postojna Cave. \"But also, we are quite scared that something will go wrong, because the eggs are very sensitive.\"\nAs the only cave vertebrate in Europe, the olm is very well adapted to its sheltered, subterranean realm: karst caves, created as water eats its way through soluble rocks.\n\"For 200 million years they were in an environment that didn't change,\" said Dr Jelic.\nAs a consequence, the animals - and especially their eggs - are very vulnerable to changes in water quality and temperature. Even the seasons barely reach underground.\nBack in 2013, another of Postojna's captive olms laid eggs - but none of them hatched and many were eaten by the other olms in the tank.\nThis time, precautions have been taken. All except the mother olm have been removed and the aquarium is boarded up, to protect the eggs from light. Extra oxygen is being added.\n\"Now it's up to them,\" said Mr Weldt.\nAn infrared camera feeds live video to a nearby screen so that the cave staff, as well as tourists, can see what happens.\nThere is almost no movement, but occasionally the female olm stirs to check the eggs, to lay another, or to fend off amphipods - small, hungry crustaceans which she cannot see, but detects using electro-sensitive organs in her snout.\nThe animal also has a powerful sense of smell, which helps monitor the eggs.\n\"The eggs have a smell, so she can recognise which are alive and which are dead,\" explained Mr Weldt. \"And because food is so scarce in the cave system, she eats the ones that are not fertilised.\"\nThe proteus is something of an icon in Slovenia, even appearing on coins before the arrival of the euro. Hundreds of years ago, when floods occasionally washed the creatures from the region's caves, they were regarded suspiciously as baby dragons.\nIn the last few weeks, the Postojna \"dragon mum\" has become quite a celebrity and carries a weight of expectation on her slimy shoulders.\nThe cave biologists feel it too.\n\"It is a challenge and a responsibility,\" said Mr Weldt. \"I'm excited.\"\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter", "summary": "\nIn a Slovenian cave visited by a million tourists every year, a bizarre and rare amphibian is guarding a significant clutch of eggs.\n\n"}

{"id": "35685613", "document": "The commission \"has today begun redrawing the map of parliamentary constituency boundaries in England\". (Separate commissions will be doing the same job for the other parts of the UK).\nThis sounds like - and, for the commission, is - a technical exercise, but the political effects will be far-reaching.\nBoundary changes happen roughly every decade, but this is likely to result in the biggest shake-up of our political map in anyone's lifetime.\nFirst, it is trying to ensure each of our votes has the same value in choosing an MP.\nAt the moment, voter numbers vary wildly, from 21,769 in the Western Isles (Na h-Eileanan Siar) to 108,804 on the Isle of Wight.\nThe Conservatives feel particularly aggrieved by this, since urban seats tend to have fewer voters, and are more likely to have Labour MPs, which can mean it takes fewer votes to elect a Labour MP than it does a Conservative one (their more suburban and rural seats tending to have bigger populations).\nThis has been an unintended side-effect of trying to respect both local geography and traditional boundaries.\nParliament says in future constituencies must have 74,769 voters (the number calculated according to the latest UK population). The commission can deviate by up to 5% to take account of geography and tradition, but voter numbers will be the main criteria.\nThe second change is the next House of Commons will be smaller. Honouring a pledge in the Conservative manifesto, there will be 600 MPs not 650.\nIn England, that means 501 constituencies, 32 fewer than now.\nTake those two changes together, and, as Boundary Commission secretary Sam Hartley says: \"These new rules mean that there is likely to be a large degree of change across the country.\" That is putting it mildly.\nThe commission had a go at this during the last parliament. Although its review was cancelled after the coalition parties fell out over it, draft proposals were published.\nThe only way it could make the quota of voters work was by crossing county boundaries and designing some very weird looking seats.\nThe city centre of Gloucester, for example, would have been combined with the Forest of Dean, and there would have been a new constituency straddling the border between Devon and Cornwall.\nLegally, the commission has to ignore the previous maps it drew up, but similar combinations are bound to recur.\nTrivial stuff, you may think, but the kind of thing that causes trouble locally.\nIt will pit local members of the same party against one another - if you're an activist in a safe seat, you won't welcome the threat of it becoming a marginal, requiring more work to defend it.\nIn the North West of England, there will be seven fewer constituencies in the next parliament.\nUnless enough MPs choose to retire, party colleagues whose seats are being merged will fight each other over the nomination.\nDozens of political careers will end prematurely, and it won't be down to the voters. It will be down to party activists.\nThe changes before the 1997 general election caused particular problems for the Conservatives.\nMany Tory MPs became part of what was called \"the chicken run\", abandoning seats whose new boundaries would make them harder to defend, choosing instead to stand in much friendlier territory.\nThat won't happen this time, party rules having been changed. In any case, it is not the Tories who are worried about this review. Although a few of them may lose out, the party is expected to benefit as a whole.\nTo meet the new quota of voters, smaller urban seats will be combined, so there will be fewer seats on which sitting Labour MPs can depend.\nAdd in the effect of new rules on voter registration, which appear to have resulted in a drop in the number on the electoral register, especially in areas where the population changes a lot, such as inner cities or places with lots of students, and that exacerbates Labour's problem: if you are not registered, you don't appear in the population statistics, so the Boundary Commission can't count you.\nAnd if a constituency is changing significantly, Labour's ruling NEC will order an open selection process for the candidate for the new seat.\nSitting MPs will automatically be included, but their reselection will be far from certain.\nThis is the opportunity activists who support Jeremy Corbyn have been waiting for, their best to change a parliamentary party far from enamoured of its leader. However, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has denied this will happen.\nEven on the present boundaries, Labour would need a 1997-size swing just to scrape into power.\nSince then, it has lost all but one of its seats in Scotland. And even if it makes a dramatic recovery, that country will have six fewer constituencies.\nThis boundary review - conducted entirely impartially but using rules determined by Parliament - could finish off the Labour Party's chances of ever returning to government.\nI understand the Boundary Commission invited the political parties to a meeting last Thursday, briefing them on how the review will proceed. The Commission team told the politicians they had \"cognizance\" of the strength of local feeling about re-drawing the map.\nThe public will have a say when the initial proposals are published in September, followed by 12 weeks of public consultation, including meetings around the country.\n\"We will need the help of residents in all regions to ensure that our proposals take account of local ties and best reflect the geography on the ground,\" Mr Hartley says.\nIf you go along, expect to be surrounded by party activists trying to persuade the commission to alter the boundaries differently.\nThey won't say they are arguing for party advantage - the commission would ignore their ideas if they did - but amid all the talk of tradition, historical character, inviolable natural barriers, they will really be arguing about votes.\nEarlier, I wrote the rules were being changed so everyone's vote would count the same. Not on the Isle of Wight, however.\nIt has too many votes for one constituency, too few for two.\nSo one of them would have to be shared with part of Hampshire. Faced with a Conservative rebellion during the legislation's passage, the government agreed to exempt the Isle of Wight.\nIts two MPs will each represent 52,724 voters.

{"id": "35830275", "document": "And there are others who don't need as much money as they're getting.\nThat in essence has been the view of successive governments as they've tried to reduce the amount the state pays in disability benefits.\nIt assumes there is a large group of undeserving benefit recipients that can be flushed out with increasingly focused assessments. The evidence, however, suggests that's simply not true.\nFollowing Wednesday's budget announcements, the immediate focus is on PIP, Personal Independence Payment, which is replacing Disability Living Allowance. The government plans to tighten the criteria for the benefit, saving £1.3bn by 2020, and affecting 640,000 people.\nClaimants, including those currently on DLA, are assessed for their eligibility by the DWP. It's a two-step process. People complete a self-assessment form and supply medical evidence, before undergoing a test carried out by Atos or Capita on behalf of the government.\nThe aim of PIP is to ensure people get the right help - and to save money. But consistently, officials have had to increase the cost of the benefit.\nIn October 2014, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that spending on disability benefits between 2015 and 2019 would total £55.9bn. In its forecast on Wednesday, that figure had risen to £66.4bn - an increase of £10.5bn.\nThe OBR said the rising costs were because of higher-than-expected caseloads - and people getting more money than ministers had predicted. The average payout is now £100 a week, 14% higher than expected.\n\"The introduction of PIP is generating much smaller savings than the government was aiming for,\" it said.\nEven if the government manages to push through its latest reforms, and some Tory MPs are said to be queasy at the prospect, costs will still increase according to the OBR - to £17.7bn in 2019-20 and £18.2bn in 2020-21.\nPIPs are benefit payments to help people aged 16-64 with \"some of the extra costs caused by long-term ill-health or a disability\".\nThey are available to employed and unemployed people and claimants can receive between £21.80 and £139.75 a week, depending on how their condition affects them.\nThis is determined by an assessment and claimants are regularly reassessed.\nFrom April 2013, PIPs began replacing Disability Living Allowance.\nThis process is ongoing and the government says everyone who needs to switch to PIPs should have been contacted by late 2017.\nCosts have also risen because claimants are being increasingly successful in appealing against officials' decisions, often helped by charities. The DWP hope to stop that - a little-noted item in the Budget gave the DWP £22m to hire more staff to attend to the appeals and put the department's case.\nThe problems with PIP are mirrored by ESA, Employment and Support Allowance, the main sickness benefit.\nWhen the Labour government announced the idea in 2006, they predicted that within a decade, a million fewer people would be claiming it than the payment it was replacing, incapacity benefit (IB).\nA decade later, the number of ESA recipients is virtually the same as those who were getting IB in 2006. Internal DWP documents I saw in 2014 described ESA as \"one of the largest fiscal risks currently facing the government\". Costs since then have continued to rise.\nWith so many errant forecasts, it's little wonder the OBR said that the over-optimism about how much welfare changes will save is an ongoing problem.\nBut despite these challenges, the OBR also concluded that the government is on track by 2020-21 to spend the lowest amount on welfare, as a percentage of GDP, in 30 years.", "summary": "\nThere are people getting disability benefits who don't deserve them.\n\n"}

They [safety workers] would tip the car over of course to get him out, so it takes a bit longer. But he was OK so it doesn't matter.\"\nGoverning body the FIA is aiming to make a final decision on the adoption of the halo by the end of May, following the completion of the risk assessment.\nIts F1 director Charlie Whiting has told teams the device will be introduced if the process does not throw up any unanticipated risks and that he expects no opposition.\nEven if a team did object, the FIA could force it through on safety grounds.\nThe FIA is still waiting for all the data to be recovered from the accident data recorders on Alonso's car before investigating exactly what happened.\nThe 34-year-old double world champion sustained a peak force of 46G during the crash, which he described as the biggest of his career.\nIt was triggered when Alonso's right front wheel caught the left-rear wheel of Esteban Gutierrez's Haas as he was trying to overtake on the approach to Turn Three.\nAll cars are fitted with a high-speed camera pointing back towards the driver's head to analyse its trajectory during an accident.\nThe device works at 400 frames per second - 16 times faster than a normal camera - and it will reveal whether there would have been any danger to the driver's head had a halo been fitted.\nThis is considered highly unlikely, as the halo has been designed to be well out of reach of the helmet even in extreme scenarios.\nThese cameras, along with in-ear accelerometers worn by the drivers and data from sensors on the chassis, mean the FIA can build up a detailed picture of the events of an accident.\nAlonso, who is one of the vast majority of drivers backing the introduction of extra head protection, said it was important to look into what would have happened in his accident and its aftermath had a halo been fitted.\nThe risk assessment into the halo will focus on the potential negatives of the device, and whether they are worse than what would have happened to the driver if it had not been fitted.\nIf the positives outweigh the negatives more often than not, that will be considered a satisfactory situation for the introduction of the halo.\nDriver egress is only one of about nine different potential dangers that are part of the assessment.\nThe halo, which was tested by Ferrari during the final pre-season test in Spain, is not the only head-protection system under consideration.\nRed Bull has proposed an alternative solution, which has a similar elliptical loop above the driver's head but differs from the halo in having two side supports rather than one at the front and a screen around it.\nBut Whiting says that is \"considerably further behind in development, it's never been tested, but it could offer additional protection\".\nThe device may be ready for the FIA to test its efficacy in protecting against a flying wheel by the end of April.\nThe test fires a 20kg wheel and upright assembly at the car at 225km/h.

{"id": "35984097", "document": "NIT was founded as a regional engineering college in 1960 and was under the control of the Kashmiri state government until 2004 when it was renamed and taken over by the federal government's ministry of human resource development (HRD).\nThis meant that admission to the college began to be based on a national examination, open to students from across India.\nThis has gradually changed the composition of students in the institute.\nAt present, 50% of the university seats are reserved for students from outside the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The other 50% is divided between students from the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu and Buddhist-dominated Ladakh regions.\nNearly 3,000 students currently study on the campus.\nThe crisis began during India's World Twenty20 semi-final clash against the West Indies last week.\nReports said that local Kashmiri students supported the West Indies, while all the others cheered for the home team.\nWhat began as slogan-shouting soon turned violent and clashes broke out.\nA few Kashmiri students told local media that they had been \"thrashed\" in the incident. This led to anger within the Kashmir Valley, made worse by a report by a courier boy named Imtiyaz Sheikh, who complained that \"outsider\" students beat him up when he went to deliver a package at the campus.\nClashes broke out again when non-Kashmiri students chanted \"Bharat Mata Ki Jai\" (Victory for mother India) and attempted to hoist the Indian flag at the university.\nPolice intervened and allegedly \"seized\" the flag and attempted to restore order.\nIndia is currently witnessing a heated debate over the phrase because some Muslims say the line equates the country to a mother \"deity\" and worshipping any god, apart from Allah, is un-Islamic.\nA Muslim legislator in the western Indian state of Maharashtra was recently suspended after he refused to say it.\nThe non-Kashmiri students allege that they are now being harassed by the faculty, most of whom are locals. They said they tried to hold a protest march outside the campus, but were stopped by the police.\nClashes broke out between the two sides and led to police baton-charging the protesting students.\nControversy over a cricket match in Kashmir is not new.\nMany in the valley have regularly cheered for Pakistan. In fact, before the outbreak of militancy in the region in the late 1980s, residents would publicly cheer for teams like Australia and West Indies.\nAnd now, with anti-India sentiment running high and with many Kashmiris feeling alienated, such outbursts are not unusual.\nPolice and unofficial university sources have maintained that the violence was nothing more than a group of senior students trying to settle old scores.\nBut some students, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said they felt threatened.\n\"We are not safe and we are too afraid to study. The faculty is not good to us and we are scared of the police,\" one of them said.\nThe local students allege that the entire incident is a ruse to shift the NIT out of Kashmir.\n\"We are a minority in the campus. What can we do? They now think that the Indian government is on their side and they can do anything,\" one of them told the BBC.\nUniversity authorities and state ministers have downplayed the issue and expressed the confidence that they would be able to resolve matters soon.\nBut the federal government has stepped in, sending paramilitary forces and a high-level team to negotiate with the protesting students, thereby minimising the role of the Kashmiri state government and the local police.\nApart from that, India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani spoke to Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti and asked her to ensure the safety of students from outside the state.\nNIT has now become the latest hotspot in the debate over \"nationalism\" in India.\nWhat has happened in the college can be directly compared to recent incidents in Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and south India's Hyderabad university, where police action has been taken against students accused of being \"anti-national\".\nHowever, the way in which the government rushed paramilitary forces into the university premises, sidelining the state authorities, has caused some concern, both about the future of the new government and the students of the college.", "summary": "\nTensions remain high at a university in Indian-administered Kashmir following a row sparked by a cricket match.

{"id": "36114938", "document": "Two weeks before primary day in Maryland, a unique campaign event - perhaps even a first in the country - took place in Baltimore: an \"Ex-Offender Mayoral Candidate Forum\".\nRoughly 100 people sat in the sanctuary of a large church and waited to hear what seven candidates for Baltimore mayor planned to do to help the formerly incarcerated residents of the troubled city. The attendees came dressed in work uniforms, carrying small children and, in Reginald Smith's case, with his brand new voter registration card still tucked in its envelope.\n\"Dun-da-da,\" he sang, pulling the card out of a file filed with information about the election. \"It's been so long since I voted - this is, like, for real new.\"\nSmith, who was released in 2012 and is on parole until 2019, was among the very first to register to vote when it became legal for former inmates like him to do so in Maryland on March 10. After a hard fought battle by community activists, the Maryland legislature overrode the veto of Republican Governor Larry Hogan and restored the voting rights of 40,000 former inmates in February. An estimated 20,000 of those live in Baltimore.\nThe US is far more restrictive of voting for former inmates than other developed nations, particularly for those who have been convicted of a felony, a term for more serious crimes that typically comes with a prison sentence of a year or longer. Maryland is the 14th state to allow former prisoners to vote as soon as they are released, regardless of additional probation or parole time. On Friday, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe announced that he is restoring the rights of 200,000 men and women with felony records by executive order, which could have huge implications for the swing state going into the elections in November. Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, says these kinds of restrictions on voting have been relaxed in 23 states so far.\n\"The trend is very much toward reform, but at the same time the sheer numbers in the justice system, the fact that the category of the disenfranchised is so broad means the impact is still very substantial,\" he says.\nLaws that took away the right to vote from convicted criminals trace their roots back to the end of the Civil War and Reconstruction, and some were an overt effort to take rights away from newly freed African Americans. As US prisons filled with a disproportionate number of minorities, the racial impact of these laws was perpetuated.\n\"Because of the over-representation of communities of colour in the criminal justice system, this disenfranchisement dilutes the African-American vote in very serious ways,\" says Chris Uggen, a professor of sociology and law at the University of Minnesota.\nAn estimated 5.85 million people in the US are unable to vote because of their criminal records.\nUggen says turnout from this population is expected to be low, even as voting restrictions ease, but it is still a bloc that can have an impact on closely contested races.\nBaltimore's mayoral race is just such an election. After the death of Freddie Gray one year ago, the city was gripped in civil unrest and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced that she would not seek re-election. Her decision created a crowded field of candidates. Frontrunners include former Mayor Sheila Dixon and state Senator Catherine Pugh. Trailing them is businessman David Warnock and lawyer Elizabeth Embry, as well as reform-minded newcomers like activist DeRay Mckesson, who is well known nationally for his activism but doing poorly in local polls.\nCommunities United, which was instrumental in the political campaign to get the laws changed along with other civil rights organisations, turned the momentum from their victory in the legislature into a registration effort, setting up tables in some of Baltimore's poorest, most political inactive neighbourhoods.

What's the difference?\nShareholders get to vote on pay every year but only once every three years does their vote have any teeth.\nThis is the moment when the company presents the pay policy. In other words when it lays out the method by which pay will be calculated for the next three years. If shareholders reject this - as Weir's did yesterday - its back to the drawing board.\nThe debate over high pay tends to focus on the injury done to our ideas of fairness and merit. The gap between the boardroom and the shop floor has become a chasm.\nAccording to the High Pay Centre, 20 years ago CEOs earned 40 times as much as the average worker. That multiple is now 180.\nThere is increasing support gathering for the view that high pay is not just grossly unfair and socially divisive, it is economically destructive.\nHow so? The argument goes like this.\nRemember, most company CEOs don't last long. The average tenure for a FTSE 100 boss is five years. Even when bonuses and pay are delayed, the period over which their performance is judged is pretty short.\nTherefore, the CEO has to work quickly. The best way to maximise profit is to keep prices as high as the market will bear while cutting costs to the bone.\nThat will increase profits in the short term but is also a recipe for a lack of investment in new products, new machinery, new training, new technology, new anything.\nAll the things that, over time, raise an economy's productivity and its citizens living standards. The amount of money businesses are investing in things that will provide long term benefits is lower than at any time since the 1960s.\nSome writers, like economist Andrew Smithers, argue that it is not too far fetched to link the decline in productivity, the amount of output per worker hour, to the excesses of executive pay.\nWe have been here before. The shareholder spring of 2012 was meant to chasten boards into more comprehensible, more transparent, and less offensive pay awards. It ushered in the idea of a three-yearly binding vote that Weir just lost.\nAnd yet here we are today with Bob Dudley trousering £14m as his shareholders suffer and, wait for it, Sir Martin Sorrell to get a pay award of nearly £70m (his shareholders made money).\nSenior city figures realise something is wrong.

Step into Roy Hodgson's shoes and pick your XI - and then share it with your friends using our brand new team selector.\nNathaniel Clyne, Kyle Walker, Gary Cahill, Chris Smalling, John Stones, Ryan Bertrand, Danny Rose.\nEverton's John Stones and Manchester United's Chris Smalling have had very busy seasons. While Smalling, 26, has emerged from United's below-par season with his reputation enhanced, Stones, 21, has faced criticism for Everton's disappointing campaign.\nSmalling is an obvious choice, topping the charts for clean sheets (17) and interceptions (98), but by using other key defensive measurements of aerial challenges won, tackles made and clearances, Bournemouth defensive duo Simon Francis and Steve Cook do very well.\nAlthough Stones does not register in the top 10 of any of the defensive metrics bar clean sheets (eight), his Premier League 2015-16 distribution statistics are the best of any other defender in the England squad.\nThe 21-year-old has made the most passes (1,569), with the most passes per 90 minutes (50.81) and has the best passing completion figure (89%), while conceding the fewest fouls (11).\nMatch of the Day presenter Gary Lineker urged people to \"stop knocking\" Stones, adding: \"He's got it all and will be a top England player.\"\nBut former England striker and MOTD pundit Alan Shearer described the defence as the \"Achilles heel\" and a problem which Hodgson has not \"been able to solve\".\nDele Alli, Ross Barkley, Fabian Delph, Eric Dier, Danny Drinkwater, Jordan Henderson, Adam Lallana, James Milner, Raheem Sterling, Andros Townsend, Jack Wilshere.\nOne name who sparked a lot of debate was Jack Wilshere.\nThe Arsenal central midfielder, 24, has been out with injury for most of the season and only made three appearances towards the end of the campaign.\nA player who might feel aggrieved at missing out is West Ham's Mark Noble. Unlike Wilshere, who has 28 caps, the 29-year-old is uncapped, but helped the Hammers finish seventh.\nHe is fourth on the list of this season's English Premier League scorers, with seven goals, and ranked fourth on the shot conversion list.\nNoble is also fourth on the successful passes order of merit, with Eric Dier the only England midfielder ahead of him, with an 86.2% passing accuracy.\nAnother left behind is Arsenal's Walcott. He plays as a forward for his club, but would likely have been picked as one of Hodgson's attacking midfielders had he made the cut.\nThe England coach cited the fact injury has curtailed his season, but the chart below shows the 27-year-old has played more minutes than three others who made the midfield list.\nDele Alli's 10 goals, nine assists and 55 chances created for Tottenham mark him out as England's standout player.\nJames Milner's statistics for Liverpool this season are also impressive. He leads the assists with 11, which were included in the 61 chances he created - second only to Leicester's Marc Albrighton, who misses out.\nWayne Rooney, Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy, Daniel Sturridge, Marcus Rashford.\nThe one hot topic regarding the striking department was the inclusion of Manchester United's Marcus Rashford. The 18-year-old only made his senior debut for United on 25 February, but has since scored seven goals from 16 games in all competitions.\nHis rapid rise to prominence is underlined by his fledgling Premier League statistics - his seven shots on target and one off target, resulting in four goals, are not enough to make the Opta lists.\nShearer told BBC Sport that Rashford \"deserves\" his call-up as he is \"full of energy, scores goals and he looks a bright prospect\", with Hodgson right to \"look towards youth\".\nThe uncapped teenager, who has not even played at under-21 level, was a popular subject on social media once the squad was announced at 11:00 BST.\nDefoe's exclusion was also discussed widely. The 33-year-old Sunderland striker was touted for a spot, and had a good case.\nHis 15 league goals helped Sunderland to safety and meant he was behind only Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy in the English scoring charts.\nHe was also ranked fourth on total shots (59), shooting accuracy (66.1%) and shot conversion rate (25.42%).\nOne player barely mentioned in the argument is Watford striker Troy Deeney. The 27-year-old was the only other Englishman to manage more than 10 league goals (13).\nHe also made more assists (seven) and created more chances (55) than any other English forward.

Shortly afterwards, the Social Democrat leader, Chancellor Werner Faymann, resigned after a revolt in his party over the failure to stop the Freedom Party, which has been on the rise here for years.\nAnd now the smiling, softly spoken Mr Hofer could be on the verge of becoming the first far-right head of state in the European Union. The run-off vote on Sunday is expected to be close.\nAustria's presidency is a largely ceremonial post but it includes powers to dismiss the government.\nPolitical analyst Thomas Hofer (no relation) says the success of the anti-immigrant Freedom Party has much to do with long-term and deep-seated discontent with the political status quo in Austria - fuelled by the migrant crisis.\nNinety-thousand people claimed asylum here last year, equivalent to about 1% of the Austrian population.\n\"The government of Mr Faymann was seen as a do-nothing government by many Austrians.\n\"It's not so much the strength of the Freedom Party that we see in Austria,\" he said.\n\"It's the weakness of the ruling parties and of course the public agenda, the refugee crisis and unemployment really played well for the Freedom Party.\"\nIn the small town of Untersiebenbrunn, east of Vienna, where 53% percent voted for Mr Hofer, a local Freedom Party councillor, Dieter Dorner, said he was \"worried about immigrants that want to change our culture, our society.\"\n\"That is a growing problem,\" he told me. \"And this makes the fear of the people grow.\"\nThey are concerned, he said, about \"the possibility that our culture will be changed radically due to more EU regulations, due to strange religions.\"\nNorbert Hofer has threatened to fire the government if it fails to take a tougher line on migrants or boost the economy. He has also said he would not swear in a female minister who wore a hijab, which he has described as a sign of oppression.\nHis opponent, Alexander Van der Bellen, has said he would not swear in the anti-EU Freedom Party leader, Heinz Christian Strache, as chancellor, if the party were to win a general election.\n\"The real danger is a Freedom Party president who dismisses the government to clear the way for a blue [Freedom Party] republic,\" Mr Van der Bellen has said.\nAustria is polarised.\nOn Thursday a group of several hundred left-wing protesters gathered in front of the Hofburg presidential palace in Vienna to demonstrate against the far right.\nSome carried banners saying \"No Nazis in the Hofburg\". One of them, Maxi, told me he was demonstrating against the Freedom Party's \"racism and inhumane politics.\"\n\"We hope we can make a statement for open-minded Austria and to give a little help to the refugees,\" he said.\nIn recent years, the Freedom Party has toned down some of its harsher rhetoric, but the analyst Thomas Hofer says it continues to targets immigrants and Muslims.\n\"It's a far-right party, there is no question about that. It has members that say outrageous things including, but not only, about the Third Reich.\n\"But they are changing their strategy. They are trying to appear more centrist than they were, like the National Front does in France.\"\nA victory by Mr Hofer is likely to be seen as an encouraging signal to other European far-right and populist movements.\nFlorian Kotanko, a retired headmaster from the town of Braunau, who is supporting Mr Van der Bellen, thinks that if Mr Hofer were elected president, there would be more damage for Austria's image abroad than for its domestic politics.\n\"If Mr Hofer wins, he won't be able to bring all his ideas in. But if Austria gets a president from the extreme right, there will be a lot of discussion about Austria's position in the European family.\"\n\"So for foreign policy and for the economy and for exports, it will be more important than for interior politics, I think,\" the retired headmaster adds.", "summary": "\n\"Immer wieder Oesterreich,\" - Austria, again and again - sang supporters of Norbert Hofer at his final campaign rally before Sunday's presidential run-off election.\n\n"}

{"id": "36425292", "document": "The BBC News website answers some of the key questions surrounding the issue.\nSEND is short for special educational needs or disabilities. The term covers a wide range of conditions that mean the child concerned requires extra support in their learning.\nConditions may include problems in thinking and understanding, physical or sensory difficulties and/or difficulties with speech and language.\nEmotional and behavioural difficulties are also covered.\nThere have been some changes to provision recently, as a new framework came into effect in England in September 2014.\nUnder the Children and Families Act 2014, SEND children with complex needs are being transitioned to education, health and care plans (EHCPs), which operate until they are 25 years old.\nThe aim of EHCPs is to put more emphasis on personal goals and to describe the support a young person will receive while they are in education or training. Those with an EHCP also have the legal right to ask for a personal budget, which they agree with their council.\nUntil they receive EHCPs, pre-existing assessments of need - known as statements or learning difficulty assessments - will remain in force. The deadline to complete the transition to EHCPs is 31 March 2018.\nFor those with SEND who do not need an EHCP, the former School Action and School Action Plus programmes - intervention schemes that tracked progress - have been replaced by a single school-based category for children who need extra specialist support.\nThe reforms were an attempt to simplify the system. They also aimed to give children, young people and their parents a greater say in the support they receive.\nThe government said the reforms would \"put children and parents at the heart of the system\".\nDepartment for Education (DfE) statistics published last year show there are more than 1.3 million children in England - 15% of pupils - identified as having special educational needs. Of these pupils, 1.1 million are in mainstream schools rather than special schools.\nThe figures show 2.8% of pupils in England (about 240,000 children) have statements of SEN or an EHCP.\nDfE statistics indicate that autistic spectrum disorders were the most common issue for those with a statement of SEN or an EHCP.\nChildren from all backgrounds can have SEND, but government statistics show these pupils are more than twice as likely to be eligible for free school meals than those without SEN (28% compared with 13%).\nBoys are more likely to have special needs - 16% of boys require SEN support compared with 9% of girls.\nAnd the black community has the highest percentage of special needs pupils, while the Chinese population has the lowest.\nParents have long complained that they have had to battle to get the right support for children facing challenges with their education. The changes introduced from 2014 were an attempt to improve the system.\nBut many school leaders say they are struggling to offer adequate support for SEND pupils. A survey by The Key found 82% of mainstream schools in England said they did not have sufficient funding and budget to provide for these pupils.\nThe DfE says it has protected the overall school budget and increased funding for children and young people with high needs by more than £90m this year.\nIt says additional funding, to help councils implement the reforms,  has included a £70m SEN Reform Grant in 2014-15  and three \"new burden\" grants (£45m in 2014-15, £32m in 2015-16 and £35.8m in 2016-17) to pay for additional costs of implementation.\nThe government also says SEND training will form part of the new core content for initial teacher training.\nThe systems in Wales and Northern Ireland are broadly similar to England, although they both have their own codes of practice.\nIn Scotland, the concept of special educational needs has been broadened to \"additional support needs\" and includes factors affecting a child's learning such as bullying, bereavement, family being in care or being a teenage parent.", "summary": "\nA survey has suggested mainstream schools in England are struggling to provide adequate support for children with special educational needs and disabilities.\n\n"}

{"id": "36641921", "document": "Stocks date back to at least the time of the Black Death in the 14th Century. Labourers were banned from leaving their homes to find better wages elsewhere and those who broke the law were put in stocks.\nEvery town or village was required by law to have a set. But being put in the stocks was a fairly minor punishment. Many places had whipping posts, pillories and even gallows.\nHere's a ghoulish tour of England's harsh past.\nStocks were used to hold the legs of miscreants - usually vagabonds or drunkards - while people threw rotten vegetables at them.\nSome places specified only \"soft material\" was thrown, effectively preventing victims from being stoned (or potatoed?) to death.\nDavid Bretherton, the driving force behind Thame's whimsy, insists being put in the stocks wasn't always nasty.\n\"If the person was well-liked they might have been showered with flowers. In other cases, they would have had their shoes and socks removed and their feet tickled.\"\nMost stocks were wooden and therefore susceptible to rot - although in some villages they were metallic.\nIron stocks in West Derby village were placed in their current position in 1902 to commemorate the coronation of Edward VII, which is a tribute rarely seen today.\nThe phrase \"laughing stock\" - defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as \"an object of general ridicule\" probably didn't originate from the use of stocks, etymologists say.\nA \"stock\" in that sense was an archaic word for a branchless tree stump or post and came to represent a person who was laughed at.\nOften confused with stocks, pillories are further up the medieval punishment rankings. Whereas stocks hold the legs, pillories hold the neck and wrists.\nWriter Daniel Defoe was put in a pillory on three days in July 1703, following the publication of The Shortest Way with the Dissenters, which was deemed seditious libel.\nAccording to History Today's Richard Cavendish, Defoe \"was put for an hour each time in three of the busiest places in London - outside the Royal Exchange in Cornhill (near his own home), near the conduit in Cheapside and finally in Fleet Street by Temple Bar.\n\"It seems to have been raining steadily most of the time, which though uncomfortable would have kept the crowds down, and the experience proved more of a triumph than an ordeal,\" he says.\n\"All that was thrown at him were flowers while his friends sold the spectators copies of The Shortest Way and [a new work] A Hymn to the Pillory which he had composed for the occasion.\"\nDefoe's experience, though, was atypical. Some people, having been pelted with dead cats and dogs, stones, saucepans and other missiles - as well as rotten fruit and eggs - were maimed or even killed, Mr Cavendish says.\nA gibbet can be any instrument of public execution, including guillotine, executioner's block, impalement stake, hanging gallows, or related scaffold, but \"gibbeting\" is specifically using a gallows to display the body of an executed criminal. Winter's Gibbet in Elsdon, in Northumberland, is where a man called William Winter was suspended in chains after being hanged in Newcastle in 1792 for the murder of an old woman.\nApparently, his rotting corpse dangled there for many years, until the structure fell apart. In 1867 a replica was built on the site, complete with a wooden mannequin. The body was stolen but a wooden head remains.\nPieces of the gibbet were once reputed to be able to cure toothache, if rubbed on the gums.\nThe remains of an original set of gallows can be seen in Potsford Woods near Wickham Market in Suffolk.\nThe story goes that a Jonah Snell bludgeoned to death a man and his son while they were working. When he was captured he was still carrying the murder weapon and was sentenced to death.\nReports claim that he was dragged up to the hanging frame on his back, giving the name \"Dragarse\" to the hill on which it stands.\nThere's a replica guillotine in Halifax, which harks back to the time when the town was a major producer of cloth.\nThe fabric had to be dried in the open air and was therefore easy to steal, so as a deterrent the crime became punishable by death in some cases.\nThe theft of items above a certain value led to a beheading. Between 1541 and 1650, 53 men and women were executed this way.\nThe replica was built in 1974 on the original site in Gibbet Street. A casting from the original blade is on display at the Bankfield Museum in Boothtown.\nA complete ducking stool is on display in Leominster Priory, Herefordshire, and the people of the town are so taken with the idea that the town clock, commissioned for the millennium, features a moving ducking stool depiction.\nIt was a wooden or iron armchair on to which the culprit was strapped. The chair was attached to a long wooden beam, usually located alongside a pond or river, and was lowered into the water.\nThe last recorded ducking cases in England are both from Leominster. Jenny Pipes, a notorious scold, was dunked in 1809. By 1817, the water in the ducking pond was so low Sarah Leeke was merely wheeled round the town in the chair.\nThe tumbrel (the wagonny bit) of a ducking stool is in the crypt of the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick.\nThere is also a ducking chair in Canterbury where the High Street meets the River Stour.\nGeoffrey Abbott, author of Book of Execution, Rack, Rope, and Red-Hot Pincers, says: \"Repeated duckings routinely proved fatal, the victim dying of shock or drowning.\"\nA replica ducking stool can be seen (and posed next to) in Ducking Stool Lane in Christchurch, Dorset.\nThere was also an instrument called a cucking stool - alternatively known as a \"scolding stool\" or a \"stool of repentance\". It was a chair placed in public view, upon which the targeted person was forced to sit while being paraded through the town.\nThe village of Stow in Lincolnshire still has a whipping post situated near the church.\nWhile the people of Norton in Shropshire were clearly of an efficient bent, as they combined their stocks and whipping post.\nThey are opposite the building, which was used as the court in medieval times.", "summary": "\nThe Oxfordshire town of Thame has announced it is considering bringing back stocks as a tourist attraction, but which other settlements have kept their instruments of medieval correction?\n\n"}

{"id": "36727249", "document": "But the biennial Farnborough Airshow - it alternates with the Paris Airshow - may not be the blockbuster festival of orders of previous years.\nWith about 1,500 exhibitors and some 100,000 trade visitors, Farnborough's pulling power remains huge.\nHowever, the event is very unlikely to see a repeat of the record $204bn (£157bn) haul of aircraft and engine orders announced at the 2014 show.\nBoeing and Airbus will as usual compete for headlines, so it's a fair bet that both planemakers will have stored up deals to unveil at the show.\nNevertheless, Phil Seymour, president of the consultancy International Bureau of Aviation, predicts a \"quiet Farnborough\" for contracts.\n\"A slowdown in orders is likely with operators moderating growth, delaying or cancelling orders and manufacturers facing production challenges,\" he says. \"There is concern amongst investors that some airlines have been expanding their fleets too fast.\"\nAirlines in Asia and the Middle East, especially Emirates Airline, Qatar Airways and emerging budget carriers, have fuelled much of the order growth over the past decade. But many airlines are pausing for breath while they absorb existing contracts.\nAlso, the production lines of Airbus and Boeing are booked for years ahead. A report published last week by Alix Partners, a global advisory firm, estimates that these two manufacturers have a 13,400 order backlog.\nEric Bernardini, head of the aerospace and defence (A&D) division at Alix, says the oil price collapse and strengthening dollar - the industry trades in dollars - have \"provided tailwinds for the global A&D sector\".\n\"However, strong airline demand, especially for narrow-body aircraft, is putting historical pressure on the commercial aircraft manufacturers who are now trying to work through record backlogs.\"\nPost-referendum politics may not help, either. It was thought that the UK government might use Farnborough to put the finishing touches to some big defence contracts, including possible deals to buy maritime patrol jets and attack helicopters.\nBut sterling's plunge against the dollar, compounded by the current political uncertainty, may mean that bean counters at the Ministry of Defence re-run their slide rules over these contracts.\nUK aerospace:\nUK defence:\nSource: ADS Group, the industry trade body\nOn the defence side, the big noise - literally and symbolically - at Farnborough will be displays by the F-35B Lightning II jet, which will be the mainstay of America's combat fleet and is being bought by the UK for use with the RAF and on the Royal Navy's two new aircraft carriers.\nOne of the world's most expensive warplanes, it's also known as the Joint Strike Fighter. The F-35 has been plagued by technical problems and cost over-runs; the estimated final budget of the project is now reportedly between $400-540bn.\nThe Lockheed Martin-built F-35 was due to fly at Farnborough two years ago, but that appearance was cancelled after the entire fleet was grounded when an engine caught fire during a training exercise in the US.\nLockheed and the US government are desperate to convince the world that the F-35 is back on track, and Farnborough will see a bigger presence than usual from Pentagon top brass and US officials to bolster support for the programme.\nIt will also be a big show for Boeing. The US giant celebrates its 100th anniversary on 15 July and is planning to showcase its past, present and future.\nFor those who love nostalgia, a B-17 Flying Fortress, B-25 Mitchell, DC3 Dakota and a P-51 Mustang will be flying as part of a huge Boeing heritage festival.\nAnd for a glimpse of the future, Boeing's new 737 Max, a revamped version of its best-selling aircraft and due to be delivered to the first customer next year, will make its air show debut.\nNot to be outdone, Airbus will pitch to the same sector with its A320neo as the European planemaker battles with its rival for dominance in the market for the next generation of narrow-body aircraft.\nAirbus's big beast, the A380 super-jumbo, will also be flying, with the company trying to convince potential buyers that a viable market still remains for such a huge aircraft.\nThe A380 is in a sales slump, and Airbus is weighing up interest from airlines for a revamped version.\nOutside the Boeing-Airbus duopoly, there will be plenty of products on sale from the next tier of planemakers. Brazil's Embraer continues to make in-roads into new markets and will have aircraft from across it three business units on show.\nAnd Canada's Bombardier will show its C-Series aircraft, a programme whose ballooning costs and technical problems took the company to the edge of disaster.\nYet, after years of scepticism about the C-Series' viability - in a few days the aircraft makes its regular commercial debut with airline Swiss and later this year with Air Baltic.\nBombardier and Embraer and others are trying to chip away at the Boeing-Airbus duopoly. Despite a slowdown in orders from some traditional big buyers of aircraft, the market generally remains strong.\nMr Seymour, of the International Bureau of Aviation, says India is growing fast. Iran, whose airlines and airport infrastructure, need upgrading after years of sanctions, is also potentially a strong market. And, he says: \"China's aviation market is still looking bright.\"\nIndeed, China has its biggest ever presence at Farnborough, underlining the country's aerospace ambitious growth strategy and ambitions to challenge Boeing and Airbus.\nChinese firms have doubled the amount of space taken on 2014, according to the Farnborough show's organisers.\nChinese firms exhibiting include state-owned aircraft manufacturer Comac, which last year unveiled its C919 passenger jet, marking a major step into the market for large airliners since a failed attempt in the 1980s.\nIn addition to building its own aerospace manufacturing industry, China has expansion plans that include building another 300 airports by 2020, more than doubling the current number in the country. This investment is to satisfy the huge growth of Chinese airlines over the next couple of decades.\nHowever, one country that won't be at Farnborough in any official capacity is Russia, after years of deteriorating relations and visa embargoes.\nAlthough individual Russian companies plan new product launches. Sukhoi, for example, is displaying an intriguing new luxury jet aimed a sports teams. The plane is kitted out with diagnostic seats and all sorts tech to assess players and athletes in the air.\nBut, according to the Tass news agency last month, Russia's industry and trade minister, Denis Manturov, Farnborough is not what it used to be.\n\"As for Farnborough, our participation will be rather formal. I should say in recent years our manufacturers have lost great interest in that event. But to some extent Russian companies will take part in the show to remind them that we exist,\" the minister told Tass.\nIt's a reminder that although the Farnborough Airshow is a mammoth marketing event, the aerospace and defence industry will always be bound up with geo-politics.", "summary": "\nThe world's aerospace and defence industry descends on a small town about 30 miles west of London this week for what is the biggest event in the industry's calendar.\n\n"}

Milne.\nFrom a building in central London they penned stories of heroic victories on the battlefield - even when the result was not that clear cut.\nTheir pieces were published in newspapers around the world and gave the impression of continued success, even when there were massive losses.\nThe government was keen to sustain support for the war when the number of soldiers being killed was rising.\nAs the First World War ended all evidence of the unit was destroyed and its work remained a mystery.\nBut, unknown to his bosses Capt James Lloyd, a vicar's son from Builth Wells in Powys who worked for MI7b, had kept 150 articles, and decades later they were discovered by his nephew Jeremy Arter.\nHere are some excerpts.\nIn this compelling account of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle it is claimed there were 20,000 German casualties, now it is believed the figure was 10,000, while Allied troops suffered 7,000 British and 4,200 Indian casualties\nThese huge plains, where roads fringed with poplars pass through well-tilled fields, are a sticking contrast to the industrial districts further north and the dismal slag-heaps beyond Bethune.\nThey are famous, too, for other things than war; for this is the Dumas country.\n...On the 10th of March 1915 began the battle which will go down to history as the battle of Neuve Chapelle, and which, if the luck of the weather had been with the British, might have resulted in the capture of the Aubers Ridge, and the opening up of the road to Lille.\nThe artillery preparation had been on a vaster scale, it was said, than ever before, and it was calculated that there was a greater expenditure of ammunition in the three days of this battle than there had been in a year-and-a-half of the South African War.\nBy the 12th of March the British had penetrated the German defences to a depth of one mile (1.6km) on a front of three (5km) miles, they had captured the village of Neuve Chapelle, had taken some 2,000 prisoners from the enemy, and had caused little less than 20,000 casualties in the German ranks.\n...Now, after two-and-a-half years, it is the Germans who attack, but there will come a day when our soldiers will come again victorious into Neuve Chapelle.\nThis article defends the British use of poison gas in warfare by blaming the German army for using it first\n...There was only one way to counter this new weapon successfully - retaliation; and Gas is now part of the armament of all the belligerent nations.\nIt is not a pleasant thing; but against so unscrupulous an enemy the Allies have no choice, if they would avoid annihilation.\nGermany must be made to swallow some of her own medicine. It is not long since she pleaded, on grounds of humanity, that the use of gas should cease in war.\nIt is a pity that she did not think of the 'humanity' before she began its use. As the good Samaritan Germany is a failure.\nPerhaps at last she is beginning to realise that she has created a monster that, in the end, shall be her own undoing.\nIn this German offensive on the Somme, Allied troops were eventually pushed back but the account reads like a victory for the British\nOn the 21st of March 1918 began the great battle which, the Germans hoped, would smash the British Army beyond repair, and bring victory within their grasp.\nBut victory is an elusive goddess, and the British Army is still very far from being a disorganised rabble.\nIt has bent but it has not broken, and German ambitions lie bruised.

In many places the scattered outpost line held out for hours, with a sea of enemies in front of them, behind them, and on each side.\nWhen the Germans came up against the British battle positions, they were confronted with a solid wall of steel.\nOutnumbered by three or four to one, the British battalions clung to their battered trenches in spite of every effort to dislodge them.\nWonderful tales are told of the valour of our men in face of these tremendous odds. Battalions, and weak battalions at that, fought with whole German divisions, and beat them off, not once but many times.\nTo take one case at random, it is related that a battalion of Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers held out all day against a division of German Guards in the battle zone.\nEleven times the Germans attacked and 11 times they were bloodily repulsed.\nThe twelfth time they succeeded, for only a poor remnant of the Irishmen were left to hold the line, but these Irishmen stayed there by the bodies of their dead comrades, and not a man of them retired.\nAll day and all that night the fight swayed up and down the battle zone, but it was not until the afternoon of the 22nd that the Germans, by sheer might of numbers, burst through our lines at Poeuilly, Beauvois and Vaux outside of St Quentin.\nIndividual tales of valour form the basis of this account of a battle at the Somme\n...This is the tale of how an Irish Battalion held out in front of Epehy, a village set on a hill, due South of Gouzeacourt.\n... For six hours their trenches were lashed with a pitiless hail of shells. At 06:00 [BST], when the guns had done their work, the German infantry advanced through the mist.\nBut it was no demoralised enemy that confronted them. Dazed men manned their broken parapets, and mowed down wave after wave of the attackers as they swarmed over No Man's Land.\nStrange tales filtered back through the fog, of bombers who hurled their bombs amongst the advancing Germans to the end, of infantrymen who charged with the bayonet when their last round had gone, of machine gunners who fought until they fell dead across their smoking guns.\n... German airmen found them, and, flying low overhead, swept the trench from end to end with their machine guns.

{"id": "36983521", "document": "In a world full of danger and drama, the Tianjin trials have won little attention at home or abroad.\nOnly China watchers and human rights campaigners freeze to attention as a mighty country, one which says it is ruled by law, holds a group of lawyers for a year without access to family or representation, and then convicts them in trials unworthy of a great nation.\nDon't imagine I'm writing an attack on China. I've lived here on-and-off for three decades and I pay tribute to China's many immense achievements since then. But this week's Tianjin trials have been a charade unworthy of a great civilisation and are surely not in China's long term interest.\nThey deserve the attention of Chinese citizens and the world.\nWith many of the bravest and most defiant in China's legal community now humiliated, cowed, discredited and jailed, who will represent the child poisoned by toxic milk powder, the ethnic minority academic accused of separatism, the feminist protesting sexual harassment or the citizen maimed by unaccountable thugs?\nFirst came Monday's \"release\" of lawyer Wang Yu. \"I felt the civility and humanity of justice in China,\" said this one time fiery defender of the downtrodden, as she admitted conspiring against her country, expressed shame and remorse for meeting foreign journalists in the past and rejected an international prize for her legal work.\nBut what kind of release is it when the prisoner emerges, not into the arms of family, friends and defence lawyer, but only to read a statement to journalists under Beijing's control.\nWang Yu may have said all these things freely. It's possible. But until she is free in the non-Orwell use of the word free, we cannot know.\nAnd so it went on all week.\nOn Tuesday, activist Zhai Yanmin admitted fomenting \"colour revolution\", repented and won a suspended sentence. On Wednesday, Hu Shigen admitted trying to overthrow the Communist Party but was still sentenced to seven years in prison.\nOn Thursday, the head of the law firm at the heart of the case, Zhou Shifeng, also got seven years. And lastly, on Friday, a subversion conviction for Christian activist Guo Hongguo to complete the Party's picture of a traitors gallery in thrall to hostile foreign forces.\nFor the Chinese government these show trials serve two objectives. The first is to intimidate China's human rights community with an unmistakable message that the Party will crush those who dare to put the law above the political interests of the Party.\nThe second objective is to paint anyone who has an alternative vision of China's future as part of an American-driven conspiracy.\nThis assault meant to smack down China has been going on for years, warns a film published this week by the Communist Youth League, accompanied by sequences of American diplomats outside the Tianjin courthouse.\nAnother film from the Supreme People's Procuratorate cuts between images of the American flag, the Syrian civil war and Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong, painting the latter as an independence activist backed by the United States, which itself is trying to turn China into another Syria.\nAgents of these Western forces are damaging China's internal stability and harmony by hook or by crook. Behind all these incidents we can often catch a glimpse of the dark shadow of the Stars and Stripes.\nIt's an argument which helps the Party wrap itself in a tight embrace with the public, warmed by the Chinese national flag and indignation against foreign aggressors who humiliated China two centuries ago and would do so again now if it weren't for the ever vigilant Party. Many Chinese citizens do actually believe this narrative.\nBut whatever the short term advantage in securing a loyal public and drilling a docile legal fraternity, the long term cost is too high.\nThe lawyers in the Tianjin dock this week were not conspirators for a foreign power. They were committed public servants assisting the most downtrodden in their society.\nSome may have pushed harder than the Party could tolerate, inside and outside the courtroom, but if that was their offence, the Party should say exactly that. Instead it has pretended that this is a triumph of justice, insisting that the trials are fair, the confessions freely given and the entire charade open to international media.\nNone of this is true and the brazen cynicism of it all would be funny if it was not so frightening.\nChina does many things well and some things less well. The question is which things are important to its people, whether those change over time and whether the system can adjust to provide more of them.\nIn the long run, I believe constitutional rights will matter in China. It is an insult to intelligence and cannot be in China's long term interest to paint citizens who dare to discuss these rights as agents of the United States. It is also profoundly unethical.\nSharpening the ideological conflict with the US is surely questionable on strategic grounds too. It is indeed part of US foreign policy to promote democracy, but the irony is that in China the US has not really tried very hard.\nInstead successive American administrations have invited China to rejoin the international community and benefit from globalisation, while accepting that it does so on its own domestic political terms.\nAs China's economic and military might rise to rival that of the US, there are a growing number of Americans who complain that they have nurtured a dangerous strategic rival which shares none of their values. Painting Washington as the enemy only feeds this fear, inflaming nationalism and suspicion on both sides.\nI'd ask the Tianjin prosecutors, if American NGOs are part of a US government conspiracy, what are the Chinese players abroad, who fund video messages displayed in New York's Time Square, the teaching of Chinese culture in Confucius Institutes or any number of other Chinese soft power projects?\nIn these frightening times, which of us knows what challenges are around the corner?\nFirst and foremost for the dignity and protection of its own citizens, but also for the sake of China's future and that of the world at large, a responsible Beijing would celebrate those who work for society's most vulnerable and talk down the ideological enmity with the West rather than talk it up.", "summary": "\nHistory is littered with tragedies in which individuals or nations betray their long-term interests for short-term advantage.

No-one else looks like they're having so much fun.\nThe athlete herself says it is her ability to enjoy the spotlight which sets her apart. \"It's how it works best for me and how I get success out there,\" she says.\nBut cheer and calmness are not the only attributes that separate the ebullient American from the rest. It has been three years since Biles, her sport's first black female world champion, entered an all-around competition and did not win.\nNo female gymnast has ever had her power, reached such soaring heights, been so consistent and performed jaw-dropping routines with such joy. \"I would make the case that she's the best athlete in Rio,\" says ESPN's TJ Quinn.\nThe differences between the three-time world champion and the others are not subtle. She is faster, stronger - her powerful run allows the teenager to include more elements in her routine than competitors who have to go further before they can start tumbling.\nOn the floor, the girl described as having legs made by Nasa can leap a foot or two higher than her rivals. Her coach Aimee Boorman has said her pupil has exceptional \"air sense\", the innate ability to know where she is in mid-air.\nBiles is also bolder and more consistent, too. Small and light, her compact body is also perfect for her sport.\n\"She's certainly doing the most difficult work we've ever seen,\" says Christine Still, a gymnastics coach and member of BBC Sport's commentary team. \"In terms of performance and her ability to perform again and again, she's the best I've ever seen.\"\nAs a child, Biles would watch older girls and copy them with ease. According to her coach, she will learn a new skill in three days, while most gymnasts take months or years to master a move.\nQuinn asks: \"How many sports can she enter? I wouldn't be surprised if she could dunk a basketball.\"\nAt this year's Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championships, Biles decided to skip the second day of competition and watched on from a hospitality box, but a group of young girls saw their diminutive hero. Biles, forced to think as adroitly as she usually moves, had to call security to stop the fans from climbing into the suite.\nIn March, Biles admitted on The Ellen DeGeneres Show she had a crush on Hollywood actor Zac Efron. If the pair were to meet - they have been tweeting each other - they could discuss tales of a life lived with devoted fans.\nIf more evidence of her celebrity on home soil was needed, NBC's footage of that St Louis routine - where Biles winked at Johnson - was reportedly viewed more than 11 million times on the internet in just the first few days.\nAnd it is no surprise to learn that the girl with the megawatt smile is the most searched female gymnast on Google and has her own emojis, with an app launched before the Olympics called Simoji.\nHer profile is increasing around the world, too. During Tuesday's team final, the five countries where her name was Googled most were USA, Republic of Ireland, Canada, Spain and New Zealand.\nFollowing her magnificent all-around performance on Thursday, she was trending on Twitter - generating two-and-a-half times more tweets than anything, or anyone, else at the time.\n\"Most Americans love her and why not?\" says Louis Moore, associate professor of African American, sports and gender history at Grand Valley State University. \"She's successful, amazing to watch, and her success helps push narratives about hard work and democracy. She's primetime TV.\n\"Given her background and sport, there's not another athlete like her historically. There's been anticipation for this moment for quite some time.\"\nBiles flips and spins on the four-inch-wide balance beam as if she were on a pavement. On the vault, she does the Amanar - one of the hardest moves performed by women - and no-one can match her height, execution and consistency.\nBut it is on the floor where she truly astonishes, dazzling spectators with 'The Biles' - her signature move - which is incorporated into the hardest floor routine in history.\nAlmost as exhausting to describe as it is to perform, it is a double backward somersault with the body fully extended, followed by a half-twist and a blind landing. At the peak of the move, she clears nearly twice her height, the equivalent of tumbling over a football goalpost.\nUntil Biles did so in 2013, no-one had ever tried the move in competition.\n\"I love it,\" says Beth Tweddle, the British London 2012 uneven bars bronze medallist. \"She's got that personality, she really showcases gymnastics.\"\n'Just give Simone Biles the Gold Medal' was a recent headline in The Wall Street Journal as the American newspaper described her as the \"heaviest favourite in the entire Olympics\" for all-around gold.\nThere was logic behind the bombast - and they were proved right as she sparkled on the grandest stage on Thursday to become only the second woman in history to hold both the world and Olympic all-around titles.\nBiles performs routines which are so much more difficult than her rivals that others would have to be near flawless and hope for Biles to falter badly to have a chance of catching her. That has yet to happen in Rio.\nThis special talent - called \"a once-in-a-thousand-year athlete\" by William Sands, a former research director for USA Gymnastics - is capable of more.\nTraining videos show Biles pulling off gravity-defying tricks on a different level to what is seen from her in competition. \"She's obviously competing at a level below what she's training,\" says Tweddle. \"She makes it look very easy.\"\nFormer 200m and 400m Olympic champion Michael Johnson once said Usain Bolt could run quicker were he to strengthen his core muscles. The Jamaican hasn't heeded Johnson's advice because he doesn't have to - he is already the fastest man in history.\nThe same applies to Biles - why attempt trickier routines in public when she is already better than the rest by some distance?\nFour years ago, Biles' fellow American Gabby Douglas arrived in London with no sponsorship - only after becoming the first black woman to win all-around Olympic gold did big businesses chase her.\nBiles, owner of more World Championships gold medals than any female gymnast in history, already has a champion's portfolio with 'wholesome brands' such as Nike, Kellogg's and United Airlines firm in their belief that Olympic greatness is a foregone conclusion.\nRick Horrow, visiting sports business expert at Harvard law school, says Biles has the \"It factor\".\n\"She has the charisma, the appearance of humility, the looks, the radiance when interviewed to build on that capital,\" he says.\nHer current earnings of $2m (£1.5m) a year, he says, could be a \"scratch in the bucket\" if she wins five gold medals in Rio and becomes a familiar face outside the gymnastics world - appearing regularly on TV and corporate events. \"The kinds of things that celebrities do beyond the sport itself,\" adds Harrow.\nShe is not yet a Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history, but she has strong foundations from which to build.\n\"She's the best I've ever seen,\" says 1984 Olympic all-around champion Mary Lou Retton, while 2008 all-around champion Nastia Liukin is equally lavish in her praise, describing her as \"the best gymnast that has ever lived\".\nBut there is more to Biles than gymnastic genius. \"Her story is incredibly compelling,\" says Quinn.\nShe was adopted by grandfather Ron, an air traffic controller, and his wife Nellie, a former nurse, as her birth-mother, dependent on drugs and alcohol, was unable to care for her eight children.\nThe girl who accidentally stumbled upon gymnastics when on a field trip as a six-year-old is also a member of the most racially and ethnically diverse group of Olympic gymnasts in the American team's history.\n\"They are demonstrating there really are no racial boundaries from the standpoint of participation in our sport,\" said USA gymnastics president Steve Penny.\nOf the five women representing the United States, Douglas and Biles are black, Laurie Hernandez is Hispanic with Puerto Rican heritage and Madison Kocian and Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, are both white.\nBiles is not the first black American gymnast to compete at the Olympics and she is not the first black woman to win the Olympic all-round gold - her team-mate Douglas did so in 2012.\nBut US President Barack Obama has spoken this year of his country's deepening sense of alienation and anger, so will Biles' Olympic achievements positively impact an America which is politically and racially divided?\n\"African Americans, especially young girls, get an opportunity to see themselves in Biles; not so much winning a gold medal, but the adulation and cheers that come with it,\" says Professor Moore.\n\"In this society, we don't do a great job of celebrating black women the way we should.\n\"African Americans also get an opportunity to see a black person succeed in a space that has traditionally been seen as off limits - but we're in the midst of a Black Lives Matter movement for a reason.\n\"Most African Americans are still fighting for equality, better schools, equal pay, access to jobs - and also an end to abuse from police and the criminal justice system.\n\"Her success should be celebrated, it's a great story, but we also have to remember that Biles' success won't change the problems most African Americans still face.\n\"In the end, however, I think her success will inspire others to dream - and everyone will remember this as the Olympics they saw Simone Biles.\"", "summary": "\nIt made sense that Buzz Aldrin, a man who has walked on the moon and lived without gravity, was in Rio to watch a teenage compatriot defy the earth's forces like no other athlete in history.\n\n"}

{"id": "37349732", "document": "The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, known as Cites, begins a key meeting this weekend with many African countries are pushing for stronger safeguards for elephants.\nIt's estimated that around 20,000 are killed each year for their tusks.\nBut Cites says that tougher rules could backfire and boost the trade in ivory.\nEvery three years, teams of officials from all the member states meet for the Cites Conference of the Parties (COP).\nThis is the major decision making body for the UN organisation that regulates trade in endangered species of flora and fauna for 183 members.\nCites works by classifying these species into one of three appendices with different levels of protection and different rules on trade. A more in-depth guide on the organisation's background, working methods and impact can be found here.\nThis year's meeting in Johannesburg will consider dozens of proposals on regulating the trade in everything from tiny frogs to sharks, to trees and flowers as well as the more high profile threatened species such as rhinos, lions and tigers.\nBut it is the question of how to deal with the current poaching crisis in elephants that is likely to be top of the bill at this the 17th COP in the Convention's 43 year history.\nThe latest research indicates that some 30% of Africa's elephants have disappeared in the last seven years alone. The current rate of decline is primarily due to poaching for ivory that ends up in China, Thailand, Vietnam and other markets, mainly in the Far East.\nSuch has been the scale of the poaching in some parts of Africa, that countries like Tanzania and Mozambique have lost half their elephant populations between 2009 and 2015.\nBut in Uganda and South Africa, populations have grown while they have remained stable or declined by smaller amounts in countries like Zimbabwe.\nAt present, all African elephants, except those in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia, are listed in Cites Appendix I, meaning that any commercial trade in specimens or parts is banned.\nIn the southern African states, the animals are listed as Appendix II, meaning that a trade in hunting trophies for non-commercial purposes is allowed, as is a trade in live animals to \"appropriate and acceptable destinations.\" However their ivory is considered to be in Appendix I and a global ban on legal trade remains in force.\nBut a coalition of 29 other African countries is pressing for a tightening of the regulations proposing that all elephants on the Continent be listed in Appendix I.\n\"The evidence for keeping these elephants on Appendix II is entirely lacking,\" said Prof Phyllis Lee from the University of Stirling, who is a participant in the Kenyan Elephant Forum, which is pushing for greater protection.\n\"They have suffered a decline, it is projected to continue and the ivory from those populations is present in the trade, all of those are significant grounds for up-listing to Appendix I under Cites regulations.\"\nBut Cites disagrees and is recommending that the proposals for up-listing be thrown out. They worry that if the resolution is passed, the extra restrictions could see some countries break away from the Convention and resume an unregulated trade.\n\"There are 90 days for any country to enter a reservation against that decision, that listing to Appendix I,\" Cites executive secretary John Scanlon, told BBC News.\n\"If they enter a reservation, the Convention doesn't apply to them for that particular species, and if other countries also enter a reservation they can trade with each other outside of the scope of the Convention. So there is a degree of risk associated with that.\"\nConservation groups are divided on the question. Many are in favour of the up-listing, saying the lack of clear data from some southern African states makes it uncertain that the populations of these countries are thriving,\nOthers, such as WWF, agree with the Cites secretariat, saying that there is already a de-facto ban on ivory around the world and putting all the African elephants on the highest level of protection won't provide any clear benefits and may actually make the situation worse.\n\"Far from increasing the level of protection, up-listing opens up a loophole window where countries who want to trade can effectively opt out of the treaty as far as elephants are concerned,\" said Dr Colman O'Criodain from WWF.\n\"That would allow them to trade and it could spark off a trade in ivory that isn't happening right now.\n\"We also defend the principle of scientific criteria first and they are deemed not to be met in this case. Of course if there weren't an existing ban on ivory trade, we might feel differently but there is. It's not the most legally tidy, but it works.\"\nThere is a great deal of uncertainty as to how the elephant issue will play out - neither the proposal to liberalise the market or to increase protection is likely to achieve the two-thirds majority of delegates needed to change the Convention.\nThere are worries that if the elephant question becomes so divisive, it may disrupt attempts to protect other, less glamorous species such as pangolins and the African Grey parrot.\nHowever, some observers believe that the convention might rally round another proposal to end domestic sales of ivory - something that occurs for antique ivory in many countries including China and the UK and the US.\n\"There are a number of governments that have done it, there are a number that are doing it,\" said Sue Lieberman, from the Wildlife Conservation Society.\n\"It won't be legally binding but it will push governments to do it, and that will make a massive difference, bigger than putting them on Appendix I.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc and on Facebook", "summary": "\nThe UN body that oversees trade in endangered species, says it will oppose efforts to increase global protection for elephants.\n\n"}

It is managed by Traffic, the wildlife monitoring network, on behalf of Cites.\nSpeaking to BBC News, Dr Richard Thomas from Traffic said that new information presented at this meeting suggested that what appeared to be a downturn in illegal ivory activities in 2014 might have been a false dawn.\n\"The indications were that the 2014 figure, it looked like there was a drop, now the 2015 data has been put in there for ivory it is certainly at the level it was in 2012/13 and that's very disheartening,\" he said.\n\"We don't know what it means in terms of poaching but it's likely to be a fairly simple equation, with high levels of ivory meaning high levels of poaching.\"\nAt this meeting there are a number of proposals reflecting very different approaches to the elephant problem.\nNamibia and Zimbabwe are seeking to liberalise the restrictions that see them prevented from selling ivory, even though the elephants in their countries are categorised as Appendix II, a lower level of protection that normally allows countries to trade in a species or its parts.\nHowever, a counter proposal from a number of other African countries seeks to raise all African elephants to Appendix I to ensure there is no legal loophole for any ivory trade.\nSeveral conservation groups are backing this tougher stand.\n\"There is no greater protection for imperilled species from detrimental trade than an Appendix I listing,\" said Iris Ho from Humane Society International.\n\"A continued split-listing of the African elephant is akin to a declaration by Cites to open the ivory trade for business.  The conservation legacy of Cites is at stake, and so is the survival of the African elephant.\"\nMany have also taken issue with the Cites Secretariat, who have advised countries meeting here to reject the up-listing of all African elephants to Appendix I, arguing that it might provoke some nations to opt out of Cites altogether and resume an unsupervised trade.\n\"The secretariat has over-stepped its powers in trying to influence policy before a proposal has even been discussed,\" said Robert Hepworth, a former chair of the Cites Standing Committee and now an adviser to the David Shepherd Wildlife Foundation.\nThere are other underlying factors that bring an added urgency to the discussions here on elephants.\nBack in 2007 similar divisions on the issue of elephants ultimately forced a compromise at Cites, where a one-off sale of ivory was allowed in 2008 and all other proposals for sales were off limits until 2017.\n\"One of the parts of that deal in 2007 was that there would be a process devised, a mechanism would be established, to sell ivory and that hasn't happened,\" said Dr Thomas.\n\"The countries that signed up to it in the belief that they would be able to trade in the future, they don't want to see that part of the deal fall through.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc and on Facebook.", "summary": "\nThe world's biggest conference on species protection has opened in South Africa amid concern and division over the survival of elephants.\n\n"}

I felt really helpless sometimes.\"\nThings came to a head when she took her music on the road.\n\"The first tour I went on, the guitarist slammed a door in my face. That would never happen now. If somebody treated me like that, they'd be out five minutes later.\"\nThe singer's metamorphosis from wallflower to self-professed \"bad mother\" is documented on her new album, The Altar.\n\"Do you see me now?\" she demands on Mind Games, while on Weaker Girl, she chastises a lover who can't handle \"the way I grew strong\".\n\"You have to have that mentality in order to survive,\" she says. \"Not only in this business, in life. You can't be like a feather blowing in every direction the wind takes you.\"\nOn the phone from Paris, she explains The Altar's backstory and why she keeps a replica of her severed head in a box.\nGood afternoon, Banks. How is Paris?\nI love it. I wish I could see more of it today.\nIs there a country you've fallen in love with while you've been on tour?\nI love Switzerland. I played the Montreux Jazz Festival and that was one of my favourite places.\nBut also - I don't know if this sounds funny - but when I saw more of America, I realised how different every city was. I always had this idea that Europe would be more exciting to me, which it was, but places like Boston and Seattle and Houston were just as exciting.\nThe Altar is out this week. Is it nerve-wracking to find out what fans think?\nYeah, it is. I feel different about it every 20 minutes.\nIt feels like a much more confident record. Did you feel emboldened by the success of your debut album?\nNo! I think I'm very introverted, first of all, so this business was very overwhelming. I was nervous to be around so many different people.\nI mean, I don't think anybody knows how to tell 50 people on a video set that they want to make changes, especially when they're young.  But I felt, for the first time, like people weren't giving me the respect that I deserved.\nAnd when I went into this album, I was feeling the after-effects of that frustration. I had this need to feel empowered. I needed to let go of that person who was afraid to say what she wanted.\nThe videos for this album have certainly been uncompromising. In F With Myself, you're abusing a mannequin that's been made in your likeness.\nThat was the most fun I've ever had on a video set! It represented exactly what that song means to me. I can be my own biggest bully - like, I'm chronically unsatisfied - but I've had to learn, especially over the last two years, to be my own biggest ally.\nDeciding I wanted to make a prosthetic form of myself and interact with it, it took confidence to say that out loud, even.\nIt's one of those ideas that, I assume, sounded really good on paper - but turned out to be quite bizarre in real life.\nIt was weird! You only ever see a mirror image of yourself, so it was strange to see myself in 3D. But it was kind of therapeutic - especially hitting my own face, because it made me want to be really nice to myself. It was like seeing physically what I do to myself mentally sometimes.\nWhat have you done with the head now?\nI have it still. It smells weird because we lit it on fire, so I keep it in a box. But it's still mine!\nYou should get it out at Halloween and scare some trick or treaters to death.\nOh God! That's such a good idea. My mum hated that video, because she hated  seeing me slap my face around. But that means it's good, if your mum doesn't like something.\nWhat about you? How do you feel about the songs now they're finished? Are they hard to listen to objectively?\nYeah, because it's like reading your own diary entries from the past: Nobody does that.\nWhen I'm thinking about a concept for a video, I love going on long walks and listening to the song on a loop. But I would never normally go on a walk and, just for fun, listen to a song like To The Hilt.\nTo The Hilt is especially raw, though. In the lyrics, you describe how breaking up with your muse left you \"drained creatively\". Was it hard to record?\nIt was hard to write, but I'm happy I did and I felt deeply relieved that I got it out of my system.\nThe vocal is very unguarded.\nI recorded it with  (British producer) SOHN and I did it twice all the way through, then I told him I wouldn't do it any more. So I think it's the first or second take. It was super draining.\nYou've spoken quite openly about how you suffered from depression while making this album. How did it affect your writing?\nI've struggled with depression since I was younger. It's just how I was wired - but it's not all the time. It usually hits me right before I give birth to something new.\nOn this occasion, it was letting go and becoming this new version of myself. It's like the universe's way of pulling you backwards almost, and you have to fight to move forward.\nLike emerging from a cocoon?\nThat's exactly what it is. The two years before I made this album, I felt the weight of learning to accept myself as a woman and an adult in this strange society that sometimes makes women feel less powerful than they should.\nAnd I don't just write when I'm sad, by the way. Lovesick is a song about falling in love really hard, and it's very uplifting. And This Is Not About Us is a really empowering song.\nYou're part of a wave of female artists - from Beyonce and Grimes to Tove Lo - who are unapologetic about the strength they derive from their femininity. Do you talk to other artists about that?\nI actually just emailed Feist because we have a mutual friend who thought we would get along. And I met Tove Lo at a festival in Toronto. She was standing side stage, singing all my lyrics. I just thought that was so cool, because for women to support each other and not feel competitive is so important. I already was a fan of her music and everything she stands for. It made me love her 10 times more.\nI heard you wrote the verses to Trainwreck when you were 14. Most people would cringe at their teenage poetryâ€¦\nIt's funny. I actually recently found this old computer of mine that I had when I was young. It had this weird app on it where I could videotape myself, and I listened back to some of the songs and I was like, \"Some of these melodies are really good.

For those against it, that argument has already been lost. The government wants a shale gas industry and on a big scale.\nThis was a planning issue. The government has ruled that the proposed fracking site at Preston New Road is perfect for test fracking.\nIn agreement with local planning officers, the secretary of state didn't think the other site, Roseacre Wood, met the planning criteria.\nWhatever the reasons for Thursday's decision, it is significant. Cuadrilla wants to carry out unconventional fracking - that means drilling wells vertically and horizontally. It's never been done before on mainland Britain.\nUsing the latest technology, the company says huge amounts of gas could be extracted with relatively little impact above ground.\nCuadrilla expects to begin fracking at the end of 2017. Anti-fracking campaigners could delay or even stop that happening by asking for a judicial review.\nThey'd have to prove this decision was arrived at in an unlawful manner, and it's a costly process. But residents in Lancashire know it's more than likely their area is the testing ground for a future industry.\nDrilling companies believe trillions of cubic feet of shale gas may be recoverable from beneath parts of the UK and more than 200 onshore exploration licences have been awarded to energy companies.\nIn 2011, all fracking was suspended in the UK after it caused earthquakes near Blackpool. The ban was lifted in 2012.\nIt is not the first time fracking has been approved since the ban was lifted - but it is the first to involve horizontal drilling.\nIn horizontal fracking, the well is turned horizontally at depth to extract gas from a layer - or layers - of shale rock.  Horizontal drilling can extend for 1km (1,100yd)\nIt is seen as far more productive than conventional vertical drilling, which goes directly through the seam and reaches a smaller area.\nIn May, North Yorkshire County Council approved an application by Third Energy to vertically extract shale gas at a site near Kirby Misperton in Ryedale.\nIn Wales the UK Government has plans to devolve fracking licences to the Welsh Government, and has decided not to make fracking decisions in the country in the meantime.\nThe Welsh Government is opposed to fracking and, ahead of the licensing powers being granted, has told councils they must refer such planning applications to ministers in Cardiff Bay if they want to approve them.", "summary": "\nHorizontal fracking can go ahead, the government has said, in a landmark ruling for the UK shale gas industry.\n\n"}
{"id": "37571259", "document": "Sanjoy Mondal opened his small clinic with just a desk and a few plastic chairs in eastern India 15 years ago, after a short stint assisting a doctor working at a government hospital.\nAlthough he has not studied medicine, Mr Mondal says he has conducted countless minor surgeries and prescribed drugs to hundreds of patients in a village of mud-walled homes in West Bengal state.\nNow, the 40-year-old is one of thousands who have been taught the basics of front-line care by a non-governmental organisation which wants to ensure patients aren't harmed by self-taught medics.\n\"I now understand what safe drugs and what unsafe drugs are,\" Mr Mondal says, boxes of pills piled up behind him on shelves hammered into the sky-blue walls of his dark, dingy clinic.\nLiver Foundation, the Kolkata-based charity offering the training, says most of India's medical establishment will criticise such a programme because they think unqualified practitioners are the bane of the country's healthcare system.\nIn recent weeks, in southern Tamil Nadu state, authorities launched a crackdown after several children died reportedly after seeking treatment from unqualified medics.\nAnil Bansal, a former head of the anti-quackery section of the Delhi Medical Council, which registers and oversees the Indian capital's doctors, says \"they are cheating the general public\" and breaking the law.\nBut the Liver Foundation's founder, Abhijit Chowdhury, believes they should be utilised because India faces a chronic shortage of qualified doctors and medical staff.\nA new study published last week in Science magazine has assessed the effectiveness of the foundation's training programme.\nThe Healthcare Federation of India says the country has a shortfall of nearly two million doctors and four million nurses. It is most prominent in rural swathes where it is estimated that more than 60% of primary care visits made by villagers are to fee-charging unqualified practitioners like Mr Mondal.\nIn Banbataspur village where he works, villagers say they turn to him because the free primary health centre, several kilometres away, is understaffed and open for just a few hours a week. Mr Mondal says he has treated locals for common illnesses like hypertension, diarrhoea and anaemia.\nSanghamitra Ghosh, secretary at West Bengal's state health and family welfare department, admitted it was difficult to retain doctors in remote areas and says unqualified medics are \"filling a gap\" in an \"overburdened healthcare system\".\nMore than 100,000 unregistered freelancers practise self-taught medicine in West Bengal, home to some 90 million people. Across India, there's an estimated one million - meaning there are more fake doctors than real ones.\n\"I'm more confident in my job,\" Mr Mondal said about the training he received, which lasted nine months with two classes each week.\nBut has it reduced the risk of medical errors?\nThe new study out last week showed mixed results.\nIt used so-called \"mystery clients\" trained to pose as patients suffering from three conditions - chest pain, asthma and child diarrhoea. How to detect these ailments were among the things taught to those who had undergone training.\nTo compare care, the mystery clients were sent to trained and untrained informal providers, as well as doctors working in government clinics.\nThe study found that although those who had taken the Liver Foundation course were more likely to adhere to checklists after training and made big improvements in providing correct treatments, it did not affect the unnecessary doling out of antibiotics and other drugs.\nThis is worrying and \"one of our goals - harm reduction - in that sense, was not achieved,\" said Dr Chowdhury, who co-authored the paper along with World Bank economist Jishnu Das, Abhijit Banerjee from MIT and Yale University's Reshmaan Hussam.\nBut the team discovered the situation was worse among trained physicians.\nThey found unqualified providers - trained or untrained - were less likely than doctors at public clinics to give out unnecessary antibiotics and medicine - reinforcing findings from earlier studies.\nWhat could explain this?\nWell for one, the study's authors say, medical knowledge among trained doctors varies dramatically because of differences in the quality of training given at India's medical schools. Second, along with high levels of absenteeism, low effort among doctors working in rural India remains a problem.\nA study published last year and conducted in the central state of Madhya Pradesh found that because untrained providers spent longer with patients than government doctors on average, they performed no worse on diagnoses and treatment.\nIn other words, what untrained providers lack in terms of classroom time, they made up for in patient contact.\nGiving incentives to government doctors is of course one approach to rectify this, but the new study's authors point out that efforts in the past have proved difficult.\nWith this in mind, and the reality that rural public healthcare infrastructure is scarce (for example, West Bengal has 909 primary health centres in total, far short of the required 2,166, according to official statistics)  training quacks - already with a large presence across India - could be more viable and cost-effective, the authors say.\nThere is \"some grounds for optimism\", they said, because \"training was sufficient to improve the clinical practice of the most regular attendees to the point where the performance of these informal providers matched that of better-trained, but presumably poorly motivated, public sector doctors\".\nThey added that training fake doctors \"offers an effective short-run strategy to improve health care\".\nThe West Bengal state government has said it will make this model a reality. Since 2007, it has funded the Liver Foundation's classes in Birbhum - one of the districts in the state where training has been offered.\n\"Training is expected to be scaled up by December and offered to thousands more informal practitioners across the state,\" says Dr Chowdhury.\n\"They will be known as village health workers and not doctors.\"\nBut it's likely to face serious resistance. In the past, the Indian Medical Association, a membership organisation for registered doctors, has taken legal action and successfully stopped similar schemes. The same could happen in West Bengal.", "summary": "\nUnqualified medics, popularly known as quacks, are routinely arrested in India for posing as doctors.

If we put them to bed it might have taken the wind out of Hamilton but credit to them, they keep on going and defensively it's awful from us.\n\"Good, attacking displays from both teams.

{"id": "37704028", "document": "The naval task force from Russia's Northern Fleet will proceed past the British Isles, down to Gibraltar, and through the Mediterranean Sea to join the Russian combat mission in war-torn Syria.\nWhy is Russia enhancing its naval presence off Syria now? The answer is part capability and part theatre.\nRussia has already flexed its naval power during its operations in Syria, with warships firing cruise missiles at land targets from both the Caspian Sea and the Mediterranean. But naval involvement has never been a critical factor. Most of the targets hit could equally have been struck with aircraft either based in Syria or flying from bases in Russia itself.\nTo a large extent Russia's naval activity has been a display - a demonstration of Moscow's capabilities and the fact that it retains ambitions to play an overseas role.\nAre we entering a new Cold War?\nHow Moscow's bombing campaign has paid off for Putin\nRussia's top spin doctor in nuclear warning\nThe deployments also underscore Russia's continuing desire to retain its small naval base at Tartus, and provide useful experience for Russian vessels in conducting expeditionary operations.\nThis latest deployment again reflects all these factors.\nUntil now though, most of the Russian naval presence off Syria has come from its Black Sea fleet, vessels transiting the Bosphorus, deploying into the eastern Mediterranean, and then returning to the Black Sea. Earlier this month, for example, two Buyan-M missile-firing corvettes - the Serpukhov and the Zelyony Dol - left Sevastopol en route for the Mediterranean.\nThis latest deployment is of a different order, comprising some of the largest warships in the Russian fleet. Leading the task force is Russia's sole aircraft carrier - the Admiral Kuznetsov - escorted by six other vessels. Chief among them is the nuclear-powered battle cruiser - Pyotr Velikiy (Peter the Great) a Kirov-class warship and the largest surface combatant (excluding aircraft carriers) in the world.\nWith it are two anti-submarine destroyers of the Udaloy class - the Severomorsk and the Vice-Admiral Kulakov. There are also four support vessels. It is likely that the flotilla will be joined by Russian submarines as well, which would typically help protect the carrier.\nThe Admiral Kuznetsov battle group will join some 10 other Russian vessels already off Syria.\nThese vessels have a long journey from bases of the Russian Northern Fleet. Their exact route is unclear, but they will either pass through the English Channel or to the west of Ireland. It is likely that the Admiral Kuznetsov will conduct some flight operations en route, as its air group works up to combat readiness.\nThe Russian warships' progress is being carefully monitored by Nato aircraft and ships.\nTensions with the West are high. Diplomatic efforts to resolve the Syria crisis have so far failed. And there has been talk in Washington about exploring potential military options. Russian reinforcements help to consolidate its position and make Western military action probably unthinkable.\nRussian air defences have been bolstered in Syria itself. And the additional Russian warships provide extra capabilities to counter air and submarine threats. The aircraft on board the carrier will also give Moscow more fire-power.\nAn added naval presence also serves to counter those in the West who have argued that a \"no bomb\" zone could be enforced by missiles fired from western warships in the Mediterranean. Russia is pre-emptively upping the naval stakes.\nBut the mighty presence of warships like the Admiral Kuznetsov and the Peter the Great is deceptive. These are rare outings for Russia's big ships. Indeed, this will be the aircraft carrier's first ever combat deployment. Both vessels have been plagued by problems. The 26-year-old Kuznetsov rarely goes anywhere without a naval tug just in case it breaks down.\nIt will also be the first combat test for its MIG-29K warplanes. Russian carrier-borne aircraft are launched not by catapult, as in the US Navy, but with a sort of ski ramp. This means they can carry less fuel and weaponry so it is likely that the Kuznetsov will have to cruise relatively close to the Syrian coast to mount air operations.\nAny cynicism, though, should be muted. The fact that the Kuznetsov flotilla is on its way at all demonstrates that Russia is one of the few countries in the world that can deploy this kind of sea power.\nWhen Russia entered the Syrian conflict there was a lot of speculation from Western experts that it would fall flat on its face, and that it simply did not have the capability to conduct this kind of expeditionary warfare.\nWell, the Russians have proved those experts wrong.\nThey have shown that they are both innovative and capable. They have demonstrated their ability to strike with tactical aviation - long-range bombers, cruise missile-firing warships in the Caspian Sea and the Mediterranean - and to sustain a reasonable level of ground operations in support of the Syrian government forces too.\nTheir targeting policy and methods have provoked much criticism. But in terms of pure military capability, Russia's Syrian adventure has so far proved a success.", "summary": "\nA Russian aircraft carrier and other warships will soon head towards the UK.\n\n"}

All countries try to ensure that the students that participate in Pisa are a representative sample of all 15-year-olds in the system.\nHowever, in some jurisdictions this is difficult to achieve. For example, parents who move to Shanghai for work often leave their children with grandparents in more rural areas. As a result, there are doubts about how representative the Shanghai sample can be.\nEven where the results are robust, it is impossible to be sure that they can be attributed to the quality of education students receive in schools.\nIn many Pacific Rim countries, attending additional private tuition classes after school is the norm rather than the exception.\nGetting robust data on the prevalence and effectiveness of these additional classes is difficult, but one estimate found that but for the effects of private tuition, the Pisa scores for the Republic of Korea would be below the international average.\nAnd my colleague John Jerrim at UCL's Institute of Education found that Australian children of Chinese heritage actually outperformed Shanghai. The \"Shanghai effect\" may be as much due to \"Tiger mothers\" as it is to the quality of the education system.\nThird, and perhaps most important, educational systems have to be understood in the context of the societies in which they operate.\nSolutions that work in countries where there is faith in the wisdom of appointed civil servants are unlikely to work as well in systems where the chief officer of a local education authority is elected by the local citizens every four years.\nThe truth is, despite all the heat that will be generated by discussions of the Pisa results, we will learn little.\nWhether this year's results are better or worse than those from 2012, whether Wales performs as well as our industrial competitors, doesn't really matter.\nWe need to improve education in Wales because of the profound changes that are taking place in society and work.\nOur world is becoming more and more complex, and so higher and higher levels of educational achievement will be needed to be in control of one's own life, to understand one's culture, to participate meaningfully in democracy, and to find fulfilling work.\nLike many others, I will be looking at the Pisa results when they come out on 6 December.\nBut I won't be trying to figure out how to improve student achievement in Wales, because we already know what we need to do.\nWe need to create a culture in which every teacher in Wales accepts the need to improve - not because they are not good enough but because they can be even better - and when teachers do their jobs better, their students are healthier, live longer and contribute more to society.\nThere is no limit to what we can achieve if we support our teachers in the right way.", "summary": "\nAs Wales waits to find out the results of the latest Pisa international comparisons of 15 year olds, Dylan Wiliam, Emeritus Professor of Educational Assessment at University College London, argues that some interpretations of the results are likely to be \"useless\" and that we \"already know\" what is needed to improve education in Wales.\n\n"}

{"id": "37897075", "document": "A significant part of the country views Donald Trump as a thin-skinned narcissist, with a loose understanding of the truth, ignorant of international affairs and comfortable with causing offence.\nAnother slice of the country sees Hillary Clinton as untruthful and self-serving, steeped in the corrupt politics of Washington.\nMillions of voters, however, see Mr Trump as a messenger of change, a man who will bring back jobs, reduce the numbers of immigrants, slash regulation and restore America's  sense of its own greatness.\nA similar number will vote for Mrs Clinton, seeing her as highly experienced, safe and a defender of liberal values.\nA large number of Americans say, however, that they are disgusted by the tone of the campaign. It was the year reality TV captured politics and turned debate coarse and vulgar.\nMr Trump's rallies increasingly became Republican revivalist meetings with an audience waiting for a cue to deliver their lines. They frequently broke into chants of \"lock her up\" at the mention of Mrs Clinton's name, or \"build that wall\" when Mexico came up, or \"drain the swamp\" at the mention of Washington.\nThe crowds revelled in a candidate who freed them from political correctness and who successfully tapped into discontent and a yearning for old certainties.\nBoth candidates drew energy from their opponent's weaknesses. Time and again the Clinton team thought Mr Trump was on the floor, brought down by his own flaws. They thought his comments about grabbing women would sink him but somehow he recovere, pleading \"locker room talk\" in mitigation.\nMrs Clinton could not escape her own carelessness over her emails and a private server. It opened the door for Mr Trump to call her \"a liar\" and \"crooked\". He cleverly - yet without evidence - painted a picture of a future constitutional crisis with Mrs Clinton in the White House under criminal investigation.\nMr Trump has had a simpler, more powerful message that America can be made great again.\nMrs Clinton exudes knowledge and detail, but as a candidate has struggled to find a compelling narrative. At her most convincing, she declared that if the middle class does not prosper, the American Dream is at risk.\nUltimately she stands for safety, for experience, for liberal values. But to make that case she has been heavily dependent on Barack and Michelle Obama fighting not just for her, but for their own legacy.\nMr Trump presents himself as a strong man who will shake up \"politics-as-usual\" but who threatens to tear up trade deals and undo parts of the post-World War Two architecture that underpins global order.\nTravelling through North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, amidst the stunning colours of the fall, you still find the warmth and generosity of Americans, bewildered by the harsh intensity of the political battle that swirls around them.\nPolitics here is broken. Congress scarcely functions. The voices of the men and women who believe in bi-partisanship and collegiality are too often missing.\nLike with Brexit there is a revolt against the establishment which cannot be ignored: the inequality; the pace of social change that rattles identity; the perceived powerlessness of those in power in the face of globalisation; the disappearance of the known world.\nAnd emerging from this vacuum is post-truth politics where facts are few and conspiracies and myths flourish. More than 300 economists have signed a letter accusing Mr Trump of peddling \"conspiracy theories over sober assessments\". But we live in an era where experts are dismissed and mistrusted.\nAnd when the voting is done on Tuesday, it may not be over. The divisions will not heal quickly.\nA quarter of Trump supporters say they will not accept a Clinton victory. And if that is the result, how can Mr Trump concede and offer Mrs Clinton congratulations when he has challenged her very right to be standing?\nAlready senior Republicans have promised to continue investigating Mrs Clinton even if she is elected president.\nThis is a profound moment for America. It faces an unenviable choice: electing a woman who is widely loathed or choosing a leader who has never held public office before and who many regard as dangerously ignorant.\nTuesday 8 November will be a historic moment for America.", "summary": "\nThis long, bruising campaign is drawing to a close.

At launch, there are 500 experiences spread across 12 cities - London, Miami, Nairobi, Havana, Florence, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Detroit and Seoul, Paris and Cape Town.\n‘Any excuse to evict'\nAirBnB has a lot of enemies, big and small.\nWhile to hosts the firm represents significant extra cash in their pockets, for others AirBnB can mean there’s suddenly a rowdy hotel on their previously quiet street.\nFurthermore, landlords across the world are deciding to put homes that would be available for long-term renting onto AirBnB instead, driving rents up and contributing to housing shortages.\n“The problem with AirBnB has never been the individual renters that are renting out part of their home or their place when they’re on vacation,” says Nancy Hanna, a Los Angeles-based attorney who represents people on low-incomes facing eviction.\nIncomes so low, in fact, that Hanna tells me she once accepted some nice fruit as payment from a client.\n“We’re seeing more and more property owners dedicating their entire buildings to AirBnB,” she continues.\n“They just find any excuse to evict a tenant. Sometimes it will just be made up.\n\"What they’re hoping is that the tenant won’t have the resources or the legal know-how in order to be able to answer [the complaint] in time and they’ll just be evicted.\"\nSometimes landlords don’t even go the official route, Hanna says, instead just choosing to casually make their tenants’ lives a misery.\n“Maybe they’ll stop offering repair services. Maybe they’ll start harassing the tenant.”\nRegulation frustration\nSome cities are tackling this issue head on. In New York, in perhaps the most significant anti-AirBnB action put in place so far, legislators have made it illegal to advertise temporary accommodation for less than 30 days if you live in a “multi unit”, i.e, an apartment building.\nRepeat offenders can be fined up to $7,500. AirBnB is fighting the law in court.\nIt’s certainly not the only city where AirBnB is under the legislative microscope. Earlier this year I reported on Proposition F, an attempt by lawmakers in San Francisco to limit AirBnB hosts to being able to sell their space for a maximum of 75 days a year.\nAirBnB pumped $8m into campaigning against the proposition. It won, but not by a lot.\nFor Chesky, 2016 has become yet another year of holding firm in the face of overwhelming opposition in key markets.\nThere’s light at the end of the tunnel, he says. He just doesn’t know how long the tunnel is right now.\n“There’s definitely an end in sight. I’ll give you the answer I gave in 2010 - a year or two!\n“Eventually here’s what will happen, San Francisco and New York, those cities will decide what path they want to go on. They will decide their fate.\n“But the people in those cities will travel to other cities and see how those cities have dealt with AirBnB.”\nChesky believes that sheer people power will be what ultimately wins it for AirBnB, and that cities that do embrace the platform will be shown to have benefitted overall.\nRace relations\nOn AirBnB, both guests and hosts are rated after a stay. This level of accountability is what the site is built around, building confidence.\nBut this kind of personalisation, where it’s good practice to share your real name and a smiley selfie, has also given rise to racism. Several studies showed that black people routinely found it harder to book than white.\nLast month, Chesky and his team sent out an email to all of its members, both hosts and guests. In it, they set out an ultimatum: if you’re a racist, clear off.\nIt asked people to sign a “Community Commitment”, a pledge to treat all people equally. Those who didn’t sign would no longer be able to use the service.\nA lot of people chose to decline.\n“I don’t even know the number of the top of my head, but it was a lot,” Chesky says.\n\"We made a decision that this is not a service for everybody. We said ‘take it somewhere else. Not AirBnB.\n“We started this company with the belief people are fundamentally good. Mostly everyone is really good, but when you have 100 million people, there are some who don’t believe in what you believe in.\"\nThose who do sign the pledge are kept an eye on - instances of racism are being monitored on the site. If a person routinely denies bookings for people with great ratings but who also happen to be, say, Asian - the system will know, and AirBnB’s staff can step in.\nIn hindsight\nRacism on the platform was a surprise at first, Chesky said - and he wished the company had realised it sooner so it could have set those out community guidelines from the off.\nIt’s one of many minor regrets he has about how the company was run in the early days.\n“[Fellow co-founders] Joe, Nate and I were in a three-bedroom apartment. We didn’t have access to any policy people, any lawyers. We were trying to do our research but we weren’t very good at it.\n“What I learned was the more you avoid things, the worse they get. We were slow to engage with a number of cities. People assumed the worst.\n\"There is sometimes distrust of new things, and a little bit of a generation gap between some of the politicians.\n“There has been at times a gap in information. But I do think government and technology are finding ways to work together.\"\nMonetising charm\nI don’t agree with Chesky when he says there’s light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to pumping money into lobbying.\nThe nature of our cities, AirBnB’s business, and trends in politics means Chesky will forever have an evolving task to keep AirBnB on the right side of public and official opinion.\nSo, in many respects, broadening out what the company does is a wise move. Becoming more than just a place to stay could bring extra benefits to the communities that feel hard done by right now. AirBnB is effectively trying to monetise local charm.\nAnd for what it’s worth, and at the risk of sounding like I’ve been “spun”, Chesky and his co-founders don’t seem hell-bent on profit at all costs in the same way other disruptive Silicon Valley start-ups often appear.\nChesky is, as your mother might say, a man that seems to have been “well brought up”, in that I buy his sincerity when he talks about doing what he can to limit the negative consequences his venture is having on communities.\nAnd his actions have at least partly backed that up. In San Francisco, AirBnB limited the amount of homes you could post on AirBnB to just one per person.\n\"We stand firmly against people evicting people in cities that need the housing to use AirBnB,” Chesky says.\n\"In San Francisco we removed all people that had multiple listings. Thousands of homes. We agreed to a registration process which caps people being able to rent their homes for 90 days. You would never evict somebody, as far as I can tell, to rent your home only 90 days a year.\"\nOf course you say that if he really cared he’d simply stop AirBnB from operating in cities with housing shortages. But he sees a different, and perhaps valid, obligation.\n\"I do acknowledge that there’s been challenges, but I hope people see there’s a bigger picture too, that lots of people stay in their homes because [of being able to rent rooms on AirBnB].\n\"We’ve agreed to restrictions. We definitely want to be part of the solution.\"\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook", "summary": "\nWhat started as literally an air bed on the floor in Brian Chesky's apartment has blossomed into a service that has more than three million locations listed around the world.\n\n"}

Muirhead floated a corner into the box and Johnsen rose unchallenged to send a header into the net.\nWalker has been in the Hearts set-up from a very young age, but his progress has stuttered due a number of serious injuries.\nHowever, when fit and available, the winger can certainly turn on the style.\nThe pace of the 23-year-old caused problems for the Motherwell defence all afternoon and, when slipped through on goal by the impressive Djoum, Walker fired the ball low into the bottom corner to secure all three points for the home side.\nMark McGhee's side had arrived in the capital after victory over Partick Thistle had taken them into the top six.\nHowever, when the Fir Park side found their way to goal, they encountered a Hearts defence who were determined to keep a clean sheet.\nScott MacDonald and Ben Heneghan were both denied by goal-line clearances by Faycal Rherras.\nJohn Souttar also came to Hearts' rescue when it looked as if the Lanarkshire side would get themselves back into the game.\nA change in formation from a back three to the more traditional back four helped in the second half, but it was too late to save a point for the Steelmen.\nHearts head coach Robbie Neilson: \"I thought we started really well with good energy.

{"id": "38252405", "document": "While I've never been there myself, I can tell you one thing: finding a parking spot at the train station can be a complete nightmare.\nSo Mayor Nora Radest was planning to do the obvious and build more spaces to accommodate the growing demand. It would have cost around $10m (Â£7.9m).\nThat's an awful lot of money, and so instead she took on an interesting experiment. Everyone who has a parking permit at the station is now entitled to a free Uber ride to and from their homes.\n\"Our innovation has the potential to shape how municipalities think about and implement parking options in the future,\" the Mayor said.\nIndeed it does. Across the US, Uber (and sometimes its rival, Lyft) are being used to slowly plug gaps normally filled by public and private investment in infrastructure and services.\nIn Los Angeles, for instance, residents living in some new apartment blocks are given $100 Uber credit in lieu of a place to park.\nIn Pinellas County, Florida, local politicians realised that in lightly-populated areas it was cheaper to subsidise Uber journeys by 50% than it was to extend a bus route.\nAlso in Florida, Altamonte Springs has all but done away with public transport altogether, instead subsidising all Uber trips in the town by at least 20%.\nIn Washington DC, those in charge of the emergency services were looking at a \"creative\" way of sometimes using Uber cars instead of ambulances for non-emergencies.\nLawrence Hanley from the Amalgamated Transit Union - which represents public transport workers -  told The Verge the speed at which ride-sharing services were replacing existing public services was \"like a tsunami\".\nAs it stands, all the ideas I've outlined above make a great deal of sense. Why run empty buses all day when you can just ferry passengers about in more comfort for less money?\nBut with local authorities turning to Uber instead of investing in the city itself, the question becomes: what happens if Uber goes bust?\nAn in-depth, ferocious assessment of Uber's finances by the Naked Capitalism blog concluded that the company was \"staggeringly unprofitable\".\nThe company of course disputes this and argues that like many Silicon Valley companies - with Amazon being the prime example - massive losses are what's needed in order to speed up growth.\nThe firm is still a private company, and thus, verified numbers are rare. But one leak at least suggests that in 2015 it made a loss of $2bn on revenues of $1.4bn.\nMuch of that loss is due to subsidising fares. If you've ever got an Uber and wondered how on earth drivers could earn money from such cheap fares, the answer is that it appears you're typically only being asked to pay about 40% of the total cost. The rest is being paid by Uber so that drivers can make an above minimum-wage living (though often not by much, as many have pointed out).\nTo date, Uber has had in the region of $16bn in investment - valuing the firm at $69bn. Plenty in the kitty, but the pursuit of growth is proving incredibly expensive, and those huge losses are showing no signs of going away: a recent Bloomberg report said the company lost $1.2bn in the first half of this year.\nUber is diversifying where it can. Uber Pool, which groups up riders going in a similar direction, is designed to be more efficient, squeezing in more trips in less time - though it still has a lot to do to win over both riders and drivers. Uber Eats is an attempt to offer a far better food delivery service, removing the mystery around when your food will arrive. And Uber Rush is the firm's courier service.\nAll good ideas - though what will really tip the numbers in Uber's favour is if it is able to get rid of the most costly piece of its operation: human drivers. On Monday I wrote about how it's investing in artificial intelligence in order to potentially speed up that process and make self-driving cars a reality. But don't expect that within the next decade.\nSo where does that leave us?\nIt leaves us wondering what might happen when Uber needs to make ends meet.\nIn a later piece, Naked Capitalism suggests only an unregulated monopoly would allow Uber to become profitable.\nBut Uber maintains that's not what's on the horizon.\n\"Clearly, we have lots of competition in the ride-sharing space,\" a company spokeswoman told me in an email.\n\"And that's not counting the other ways that people can choose to get around, including public transit, bicycles, rental cars, taxis, carpools and, of course, private cars.\"\nThis statement may be true today, but with local authorities deciding to go with Uber instead of investing in public transport, the number of affordable alternative options to Uber is beginning to shrink.\nRegardless, Uber is doing its best to reassure consumers that it won't put up prices - as it wants to make Uber more affordable than using your own car.\nBut at the same time, it's telling investors that the reward for backing it through the losses is that eventually the company will be big enough to make the numbers work.\nCan it please everyone? There is a fear that once Uber is in a truly dominant position, it will simply raise prices in order to finally balance the books. It can't subsidise drivers forever, and while it claims to be able to bring costs down by making its service more efficient, those savings don't yet seem significant enough to turn things around.\nFor the towns and cities that chose to work with Uber, this could put them in a very difficult situation. Stop paying Uber, and entire parts of town could be suddenly cut off from affordable public transport. Imagine having to worry if the school run was going to be affected by surge pricing.\nTowns like Summit would perhaps be left with no option other than to spend more to cover the imbalance of Uber's business model - after all, they never did build the car park they so desperately needed.\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook", "summary": "\nThe town of Summit, New Jersey, is about 30 miles west of Manhattan.

He said with too few beds available admitting patients was too difficult.\n\"Furthermore, there is also a real and urgent need for a greater number of emergency medicine staff at the frontline.

{"id": "38754047", "document": "A week is just a week, but when it comes to strategic focus, China is on course. It's easier to look laser sharp when the competition is in disarray. Here the internal difficulties of the US and the European Union are helpful to China.\nAs Chinese Foreign Ministry official Zhang Jun put it in a discussion with foreign journalists: \"If people want to say China has taken a position of leadership, it's not because China suddenly thrust itself forward as a leader. It's because the original front-runners suddenly fell back and pushed China to the front.\"\nIn the past week alone, a bitter row over the size of the crowd at the Trump inauguration, followed by street protests the next day, underlined the divisions of the world's superpower even at the very moment which was supposed to heal.\nFor China's citizens, brought up to see street protests as dangerous, this was another symptom of dysfunction in a political system they've been taught to distrust.\nAnd next, an American president echoed Beijing's message that the mainstream American media can't be trusted.\nSo it's been a week to put a spring in the step of China's communists, to shake off the inferiority complex of an autocratic political system, and even to advance the claim that China's system is superior.\nAmong business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, President Xi talked the language of global togetherness, but back home his Communist Party's flagship newspaper, the People's Daily, lost no time in declaring the bankruptcy of Western politics.\n\"The emergence of capitalism's social crisis is the most updated evidence to show the superiority of socialism and Marxism,\" it said.\nThis ideological inoculation is invaluable for Xi Jinping ahead of the vital Communist Party Congress which will clarify China's leadership line-up for the next five years.\nWhat's more, greater political confidence at home allows him to focus out.\nThe inauguration of a billionaire celebrity promising to make America great again through building walls confirms the view of some in Beijing that the United States is in terminal decline, and that this is a moment of opportunity for China.\nPresident Xi's favourite slogans are the \"China Dream\" and the \"great rejuvenation of the Chinese people\". But it's all happening faster than his predecessors could have imagined.\nIt's less than two decades since China fully entered a US-led world of global capitalism.\nWhen China joined the World Trade Organization, it complained bitterly about living under rules made by the US and its friends, while fully expecting to live under those rules for decades to come.\nBut November's American presidential election finished what the 2008 financial crisis had begun: a shift in worldview. And now we are one week into the new leadership mission set out by President Xi at Davos.\nA word about character.\nIn China there are some who compare Mr Trump's character and leadership style with China's Chairman Mao. They point to the former's relentless tweeting as a new version of the latter's daily deluge of quotations.\nThey note other similarities: the unpredictability, distrust of media, and overwhelming self-confidence.\nSome admire and some despise, but Donald Trump, they say, is a great disrupter in the Maoist mould.\nAll of which is a discussion which takes some of the heat off President Xi at home. Until recently critics accused him of Maoist tendencies after his relentless concentration of titles and power and his frenetic media personality cult.\nBut as China's citizens look out on a world of strongmen this week, their own president may seem comparatively sober, predictable and experienced: not too much the Caesar, nor too little, for a global leader in our age.\nMeanwhile Mr Xi's outward facing message, that China wants a world of fair trade and globalisation, got a boost this week from several quarters, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).\nThe Chinese-led development bank said it is set for expansion. It currently has nearly 60 members and now says another 25 are likely to join this year.\nTwo years ago when the AIIB was launched, it became a symbol of the pulling power of China's money and nimble diplomacy when US allies lined up to join despite strong US opposition.\nThis week, AIIB president Jin Liqun told journalists, it was China's turn to contribute to the world: \"China needs to do something that can help it be recognised as a responsible leader.\"\nBut in the long view, if this week is to be remembered as a tipping point towards Chinese power, it will not be because of anything announced in Beijing but because of what happens in Washington.\nOne of President Trump's first acts in office was to sign an executive order withdrawing the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact which the Obama administration had insisted would cement US leadership in Asia.\n\"Protection will lead to greater strength\", said Mr Trump. But in an open letter, outgoing US ambassadors in the region disagreed.\n\"Walking away from TPP may be seen by future generations as the moment America chose to cede leadership to others in this part of the world and accept a diminished role.\"\nCertainly in response to the Trump announcement, US ally and TPP signatory Australia immediately said it hoped to recast the trade agreement without the US, and said China might be invited to join.\nAsia is the key testing ground where the US stands in the way of China's ambitions.\nSince the end of World War Two, Washington has insisted that the US is in Asia for the good of all and invested decades in diplomacy and defence to maintain the liberal international order.\nOn the campaign trail, Mr Trump expressed impatience with that investment. And having withdrawn from the TPP, the Trump administration will have to find a new way to nurture key allies and partners in the region and to reassure them that 'America first' does not mean everyone else last.\nBut at the same moment, China's diplomats and bankers are stepping up their efforts and their focus does not waver.\nLast year, Beijing turned an international legal defeat over the South China Sea into a diplomatic triumph by charming and disarming the Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.\nIn the Trump era, it has other US allies in its sights. Only this week, Thailand confirmed funding for the purchase of a Chinese submarine.\nBut on security, the week also saw a cloud on China's leadership horizon.\nThe new White House spokesman Sean Spicer seemed to echo warnings to China from incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when he sketched out a position on the South China Sea.\n\"We're going to make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country,\" said Mr Spicer.\nIt's not clear exactly what he meant or exactly what Mr Tillerson meant, but a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman immediately restated China's claim to sovereignty in the region, and insisted that Beijing would be resolute in defending its own rights and interests.\nIf the Trump administration is to push back against China in the South China Sea it will need support from US allies who ask themselves whether Mr Trump has the strategic focus necessary for such a risky undertaking.\nChina will naturally encourage those doubts given its preference for making domination of the South China Sea a fait accompli with as little fuss as possible.\nBut there are many players, many unpredictable variables and many wrong moves in this game.\nOne week into the new world order, China's leaders may feel some things are playing into their hand. But it will be many months, perhaps years, before they can judge whether China's global gamble is a win against Trump's America.", "summary": "\nAt his inauguration last week President Trump reframed the American mission from leadership of a global rules-based system in the interests of all, to 'America first'.

And he can now sell the fish via Abalobi before he has returned to shore, easily finding out the best possible price.\n\"It has removed a lot of the worry,\" he says. \"I have a wife and three kids to support, and it gives me much more security.\"\nWith the help of a growing number of apps and digital services such as Abalobi, it has never been easier to pinpoint the exact spot where the prized fish await, and then sell them after you have caught them.\nBut with ever increasing concerns about depleting global fish stocks - the United Nations claims that 90% of the world's stocks are either full-fished or over-fished - is that a good thing?\nMany of the digital fish trackers, including Abalobi, claim to have conservation at their heart, but not everybody is convinced.\n\"The problem is that in practice all that happens is unscrupulous people use apps to target the fish and wipe them out even quicker,\" says UK fishing expert Matt Hayes, who runs an Atlantic salmon fishery in Norway.\nHe is also worried that small-scale fishermen could ultimately become unemployed.\n\"You don't want to deprive someone of a living, but you don't want to bestow upon them the tech that means they will fish themselves out of existence.\n\"I wrestle with it a lot. It concerns me.\"\nHowever, Dr Clive Trueman, associate professor of marine ecology at the UK's National Oceanography Centre, is more positive about apps like Abalobi.\n\"It's nothing that commercial fishermen haven't been doing by word of mouth for centuries,\" he says.\n\"Some of these apps may also end up being very effective for scientists and managers to work out where the fish are, and where they are going.\n\"We can use them to catch more fish, but also to direct conservation.\"\nSerge Raemaekers, a fisheries researcher at Abalobi, says that conservation is at the very centre of their scheme.\nUsing Google's cloud platform technology, data collected by the fishermen is to be shared with students at the University of Cape Town who are monitoring the sustainability of South Africa's fish stocks.\nThe fishermen can also use the technology to monitor stocks, and stay away from any areas where they themselves think the fish population should be left to recover.\nTechnology is also being used on a worldwide scale to protect fish stocks.\nIn September last year, Google joined with ocean conservation group Oceana to launch Global Fishing Watch (GFW), a free platform that tracks the location of the world's commercial fishing boats.\nIt does this by utilising the fact that more than 200,000 sea vessels constantly transmit their position, speed and direction via the global automatic identification system (AIS).\nGFW, which also uses Google's cloud computing services, already has more than 25,000 registered users, and more using the website without logging in.\n\"Anyone who is interested in a vessel, and wants to know where it is today, can go to a variety of sources that provide real-time data, and see where it is at that moment,\" says Jackie Savitz, senior vice president at Oceana.\n\"Authorities find out suspicious activity and then track vessels down.\"\nSuspicious activity includes ships that switch off AIS or don't use it at all.\n\"It's possible the bad guys turn off AIS,\" says Ms Savitz. \"But we can see when they turn it off, and we see it when it comes back on.\"\nGFW has already notched up some success stories - using its data, a vessel was caught fishing in the Phoenix Islands Protected Area in the Central Pacific and forced to pay a $2m (Â£1.6m) fine to the Republic of Kiribati, one of the poorest countries in the world.\nIn Italy, the University of Bari has partnered with US technology group IBM since 2012 to pilot a similar cloud-based fishing app to Abalobi.\nThe organisations say it has resulted in more targeted fishing, with the fishermen only catching as many fish as the market demands.\nBack at Abalobi - which means \"traditional fisher\" in the isiXhosa language - the project has secured grants from the South African government. It has also been helped by mobile phone network Vodacom allowing the app to be used data-free.\nMore than 100 South African fishermen are now signed up, and Mr Raemaekers says Abalobi is receiving interest from groups in the Seychelles and the UK.\nMr Shoshola adds that using the service is helping him and his three friends expand the business, because for the first time they have recorded data that they can take to the bank and use as evidence to help them hook some loans to grow their fishing operation.\n\"I have got the numbers of every daily catch,\" says Mr Shoshola.", "summary": "\nBraving the choppy waters of the South Atlantic four days a week, fisherman David Shoshola says a mobile phone app is helping him worry less about the risk of not being able to support his family.\n\n"}

She has earned the trust of the president as an aide of unquestioned loyalty. Will the president be willing to punish such a transgression?\nThis also raises the possibility of a strategic benefit to Ms Conway's involvement in this growing conflagration. Like a destroyer taking a torpedo to save an aircraft carrier, she has deflected the political blast from the Nordstrom controversy away from her president, whose questionable tweet set everything off.\nWhile Ms Conway's remarks were ill-advised and very likely a violation of the law, Mr Trump's use of presidential power to protect his family's business interest is of greater national concern.\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said Ms Conway had been \"counselled\" after her remarks.\nBut the calls for further investigation or sanctions are growing. \"It's a violation of the rule,\" Norman Eisen, a former ethics adviser to Barack Obama, told MSNBC. \"It's a serious matter.\"\nTwo liberal lobby groups have filed complaints with the Office of Government Ethics.\n\"Conway's action reflects an ongoing careless disregard of the conflicts of interest laws and regulations by some members of the Trump family and Trump administration,\" Craig Holman, government affairs lobbyist for one group, Public Citizen, told AP.", "summary": "\nThe standards chief of the US Congress says a senior Trump aide was \"wrong, wrong, wrong\" to promote Ivanka Trump products on live television.\n\n"}

{"id": "39102953", "document": "The Commons Education Committee report echoes councils' calls to be allowed to use their expertise to help boost performance in failing academies.\nThe government wants all English schools to become academies, independent of local councils and funded direct by Whitehall.\nMinisters say there is no legal basis for councils to sponsor academies.\nWhen schools become academies, they are overseen by academy trusts, and increasing numbers are part of chains, otherwise known as multi-academy trusts (Mats).\nThese are responsible for providing their academies with advice, support, expertise and a strategic overview.\nWhat does it mean to be an academy school?\nAs of March last year, almost two-thirds of England's 5,758 academies and free schools were in Mats.\nBut there are significant concerns about the performance, accountability and expansion of multi-academy trusts, according to the MPs' report.\n\"There remains a high degree of uncertainty about the effectiveness of Mats, and there is not yet the evidence to prove that large-scale expansion would significantly improve the school landscape,\" says the report.\n\"Only time will tell whether multi-academy trusts are more successful than local authorities at creating and supporting high-performing schools and tackling underperformance.\"\nThe numbers of Mats almost trebled from 391 in 2011 to 1,121 in 2016, and the government envisages that most schools will have converted to academy status and joined a Mat within five or six years, says the report.\nBut MPs say the government has \"a long way to go\" to demonstrate that public money spent on academies \"is being used effectively\".\nThey also want Ofsted to have the power to conduct full inspections of Mats, instead of focused inspections of schools within Mats.\nOfsted's latest annual report found some trusts \"showed the same weaknesses as the worst performing local authorities\".\nPupils in schools run by these trusts made poor progress, leaders overestimated teaching quality and the trusts lacked strategic oversight and the will to tackle weak leadership, Ofsted found.\nNeil Carmichael, who chairs the committee, said that while some trusts produced excellent results and made \"a valuable contribution to our education system, a considerable number are failing to improve and are consistently at the bottom of league tables\".\n\"If the government is to pursue the goal of further academisation, it will need to work with local authorities and allow those councils with a track record of strong educational performance to use their expertise within their education department to create MATs,\" said Mr Carmichael.\nThe Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, said that with 91% of council schools now rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, it was time for the government to recognise councils' record in school improvement.\nRichard Watts, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board, said allowing local authorities to set up trusts would mean that parents worried about an academy could be sure that \"the council and its directly elected councillors, who know their local schools and the communities they serve better than anyone else, will be able to step in and help\".\nThe  Department for Education said there was no legal framework to allow councils to run MATs as fewer than 20% of members and trustees are allowed to be \"local authority influenced\".\nHowever, a spokesman added that local authorities could be part of a MAT \"with up to a fifth of its board having links to their local authority\".\n\"We encourage all trusts to work collaboratively and the best already do so, but maintaining their independence is a crucial part of encouraging the innovation that has driven up standards in so many schools,\" said the spokesman.", "summary": "\nLocal authorities in England should be able to form their own academy chains, MPs have said.\n\n"}

The Obama Administration, and its predecessors, have used these options, but we can expect President Trump to do it more.\nThe options include using the WTO's dispute settlement system - a kind of judicial procedure. There are also actions that WTO rules allow countries to take unilaterally, against dumped or subsidised goods and sudden surges in imports.\nTrump speech to Congress in full\nRepublicans baulk at Trump's budget plan\nTrump lays out hike in military spending\nBut there are also hints that the US might be willing to by-pass the rules, \"when the WTO adopts interpretationsâ€¦ that undermine the ability of the US and other WTO members to respond effectively to these real world unfair trade practices\".  When that happens, the report says it undermines confidence in the global trading system.\nIt is also striking that the report emphasises the status of WTO rules in US law. Even if the US loses in a dispute \"it does not automatically lead to a change in US law or practice.\"\nOne complaint in the report is the fact that some countries maintain \"high tariffs\" (taxes applied only to traded goods) which block access to their markets.\nBut tariffs are allowed under WTO rules. Each WTO member country has made commitments to keep tariffs at or below a certain level. They are different for different countries and different goods.\nThese maximum tariff levels were the outcome of the long set of negotiations that established the WTO. And in some cases they are very high.\nIn the US and other rich countries they generally are relatively low, although there are some sectors - especially agriculture where there are some high tariffs. Any reduction in those maximum levels would have to be negotiated - something that WTO members have been trying to do with little success.\nSo, how will the US act on these ideas? We have to wait and see.\nBut the challenge has been noted at WTO Headquarters. The agency's director-general Roberto Azevedo issued a statement saying:\n\"It is clear that the United States has a variety of trade concerns, including about the WTO dispute settlement system.\n\"I am ready to sit down and discuss these concerns and any others with the trade team in the US whenever they are ready to do so,\"", "summary": "\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has signalled a new and \"aggressive\" approach to international trade.\n\n"}

The medical ward at Raigmore is full which means an ambulance will be called upon to transfer the frail, confused woman into A&E to wait for a bed to become free.\nLater we meet 85-year-old Janet Lamont. She is staying with her son and daughter-in-law in Inverness. She has become breathless and is feeling unwell.\nLouise was able to put her on a nebuliser and give her medication to help get her temperature down.\nWithin 20 minutes, Janet is sitting up.

In the main, she says very few people question why they are not seeing a doctor.\nThe team covers an area that stretches from Fort William through to Cromarty on the Black Isle. Much of the night can be spent in the car, but tonight most of the calls are local.\nUntil midnight a GP works with Louise. There is also a community psychiatric nurse who deals with cases right across the Highlands.\nAfter midnight medical back-up comes from the emergency room doctor. I'm surprised at how small a team it is and how busy it is. And I see for myself the pressures on the staff.  No beds in the ward, means a patient taking up a bed in A&E.

{"id": "39235508", "document": "It looks pretty certain that MPs will strike down the two amendments made to the bill in the House of Lords, on Monday afternoon, and that peers will then concede on both points later that evening - at which point the bill can be sent off to Her Majesty for the Royal Assent.\nThat could clear the way for a bit of drama, because the prime minister could then be in a position to announce she had served the UK's divorce petition on its EU partners, when she comes to the Commons on Tuesday, to report back on the latest EU summit.\nWe shall see, but I suspect the champagne is on ice in the government whips' office.\nBut after nearly six weeks of parliamentary sound and fury, the bill seems pretty certain to be un-amended, and the main interest in proceedings may well be the extent to which ministers give assurances on the two issues which provoked amendments in the Lords.\nFirst, the position of EU citizens resident in the UK. Ministers have been adamant that they intend to guarantee their right to live and work here, and the most pro-EU Tory backbenchers accept their good faith, and will not rebel on this.\nSecond is the \"meaningful vote\" - the call for Parliament to be given a vote on the divorce settlement before it is put to the European Parliament, and in good time to be able to send ministers back to the negotiating table, if they don't like the deal.\nAgain, the possible pro-EU rebels in the Tory ranks are keener on getting assurances out of the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, than on backing a Lords amendment. And there is also some Brexiteer suspicion that the amendment passed by peers is in reality a trap designed to keep Britain in the EU if divorce talks fail to produce a settlement to the liking of Parliament.\nAnd there's also a side battle for credit for any government concessions on either issue, with Labour plotting manoeuvres designed to show it was their efforts wot won any ministerial guarantees.\nIn any event, once MPs have pinged the bill back to the Lords, the expectation is that the critical mass of peers behind the original amendment will have eroded somewhat - the Crossbenchers seldom want to push the elected House of Commons too far, while Labour is engaged in an awkward balancing act between the pro-Leave and pro-Remain sections of its electoral heartlands, and may not wish to push its luck.\nWhich leaves the Liberal Democrats, who may well force a vote, but who don't have the numbers to win it.  So that will be that.\nMeanwhile there's some significant action elsewhere - perhaps the biggest defeat the government may suffer next week could be on the immigration status of students, in a key amendment to the Higher Education and Research Bill - watch this space.\nHere's my rundown of the week ahead:\nThe Commons week opens (2.30pm) with Defence questions.\nThe day's Ten Minute Rule Bill looks particularly interesting and contentious. Labour's Diana Johnson is proposing to remove the criminal law underpinning of current abortion legislation.\nAbortion is a criminal offence under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, unless conducted under the strict rules set in the 1967 Abortion Act....which means that a woman who buys pills on the internet to induce a miscarriage is committing an offence that potentially could lead to life imprisonment.\nSimilarly, a doctor conducting an abortion without meeting the terms of the 1967 Act, with two doctors signing off on the procedure could also face jail. She argues the criminal law should not be used, for example, against a woman in an abusive relationship who did not want a pregnancy, and that professional bodies like the GMC would be better placed to discipline doctors who broke the rules.\nAnd she adds that a change in the law is supported by the Royal College of Midwives. But expect a pro-life MP to oppose the bill, and force a vote.\nThen the House will deal with the amendments made by peers to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill (see above). And after that, MPs continue the Budget debate. Watch out for ministerial smoke signals about the controversial proposed changes to National Insurance for self-employed people.\nIn Westminster Hall (4.30pm) MPs will debate e-petition 166711 to \"April's  Law\" signed by 126,070 people, on sentencing for child abuse offences - it calls for the government to make all sex offenders remain on the register for life no matter the crime, and for internet service providers and search engines to be better policed regarding child abuse images and for tougher sentences on those caught with indecent images of children.\nIn the Lords, from 2.30 pm, there's a great deal going on. The Article 50 bill is expected back from the Commons at about 8.30pm (see above) but before that there's some significant action on the report stage of the Higher Education and Research Bill (day 3).\nThe government's already been defeated five times on this bill, which has now been extensively rewritten since arriving in the Lords. And the process isn't over yet.\nThe remaining issues include preventing retroactive changes to student loan arrangements, and a cross-party new clause (signed by, amongst others, Lord Patten of Barnes, the Chancellor of Oxford University) which states:\n\"the Secretary of State shall ensure that no student, either undergraduate or postgraduate, who has received an offer to study at such a higher education provider, be treated for public policy purposes as a long term migrant to the UK, for the duration of their studies at such an establishment.\"\nIf passed, this could give the government an awkward moment when the bill bounces back to the Commons to allow MPs to consider amendments made in the Lords - 36 Conservatives have signed a letter to the prime minister supporting the change, and MPs are under considerable pressure from higher education to ensure they can continue to attract foreign students and academics.\nThere's also a new clause from the Crossbencher Baroness Deech on freedom of speech in higher education, the Lib Dem Lord Storey to create a new offence of providing or advertising cheating services and his party colleague Lord Sharkey is pushing for Sharia-compliant student finance.\nDuring the dinner break, there will be a short debate on combating neglected tropical diseases since the London Declaration on the subject, which committed signatories to action against Guinea worm disease, lymphatic filariasis, leprosy, sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis) blinding trachoma, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthes, Chagas disease, visceral leishmaniasis and river blindness (onchocerciasis). Former Lord Speaker Baroness Hayman leads proceedings.\nThe Commons opens (11.30am) with Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy questions. Then comes an intriguing Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative Nusrat Ghani to encourage the diplomatic service to purchase wines and sparkling wines produced in the United Kingdom and to serve them at overseas functions and events\nThen, the prime minister is expected to report back on the latest EU summit - will she be in a position to announce that she has served formal notice on the EU that the UK wishes to leave?\nThat is followed by the conclusion of the four-day Budget debate.\nIn Westminster Hall (9.30am- 11am) there's a debate on budgets for health and social care - part of the continuing campaign by a triple alliance of the Public Accounts, Health and Communities and Local Government Committees to highlight their concerns about the sustainability of the NHS budget in England - so watch out for contributions from the PAC's Meg Hillier, the Health Committee's Dr Sarah Wollaston and the DCLG Committee's Clive Betts, challenging the government on its Budget pledges to provide temporary funding boosts to social care and NHS capital funding.\nOther subjects debated include the future of food labelling (11am-11.30am); detention of vulnerable persons (2.30pm-4pm) and dog fouling (4.30pm-5.30pm).\nMy committee picks are the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs hearing (10am) with three party leaders of the House of Lords: Baroness Smith of Basildon (Labour), Lord Hope of Craighead (convenor of the Crossbenchers), and Lord Newby (Lib Dem), to identify the \"unarguable next steps\" for reforming the Lords. They will be quizzed on when it is appropriate for the Upper House to exercise its powers, and how, as a revising House, it can be made smaller and more effective.\nAnd watch out for another example of cross-committee co-operation as Education and Health select committees combine (2.30pm) to take evidence on child mental health - examining the role of education in promoting emotional wellbeing in children and young people and preventing the development of mental health problems.\nThe session will hear from psychologists, head teachers and campaigners, including Professor Dame Sue Bailey, Chair of the Children's and Young People's Mental Health Coalition, Sarah Brennan, Chief Executive of Young Minds, and Dr John Ivens, head teacher at the Bethlem and Maudsley Hospital School.\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) the main event is peers' debate on the economy in the light of the Budget.\nAnd there will also be a short debate on undertakings made in Our Commitments to you for end of life care: The Government Response to the Review of Choice in End of Life Care - led by Baroness Finlay of Llandaff, who is a professor of palliative medicine.\nThe Commons opens (11.30am) with Northern Ireland questions - which, given the political upheavals following the latest assembly elections, will be closely scrutinised for hints of the government's and the parties' attitudes.\nPrime Minister's Questions follows at noon, and then comes a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the SNP's Drew Hendry, which aims to transfer Network Rail's land and assets in Scotland to an agency controlled by the Scottish government - on the argument that they have responsibility for rail services, but have to deliver any improvements through Network Rail, so they cannot control costs. Apparently this has become quite an irritant.\nA rather scrappy afternoon follows. There's provision for MPs to react to further Lords amendments to the Article 50 Bill, if it is still in play, and they will also deal with Lords amendments to the Health Service Medical Supplies (Costs) Bill, and MPs will also polish off their consideration of the National Citizen Service Bill.\nThere's also a motion relating to appoint a new set of lay members to the Commons ethics watchdog, the Committee on Standards. The will have the ability to make their concerns known if they believe the committee has, for example, been too lenient on some erring MP.\nIn Westminster Hall, watch out for the debate on maternity discrimination (9.30am -11am). This will be the start of a two-week long campaign leading to Mother's Day and campaigners including Labour's Sarah Champion will be highlighting that 54,000 women a year are forced out of work because they are pregnant.\nOther debates include: police widows' pensions (11am-11.30am); the cost of GP indemnity in England (2.30pm-4pm) and the implications for the Scottish devolution settlement of triggering Article 50 (4.30pm-5.30pm).\nMy committee pick of the day - inevitably - is the Exiting the European Union hearing (9.15am) with the Brexit Secretary, David Davis.\nIn the Lords (3pm), the main events are the third reading of the Neighbourhood Planning Bill - expected to be a rapid rubber-stamping - and the fourth day of report stage debate on the Higher Education and Research Bill - where the key issues are likely to include the research aspects such as the business focus of Innovate UK, UKRI regard for institutional autonomy, and the Haldane principle.\nThe Commons opens (9.30am) with Culture, Media and Sport questions, and then, questions to the Attorney General. Next comes the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House.\nThe day's main events are scheduled by the Backbench Business Committee. There will be two select committee statements: first from Bernard Jenkin, chair of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, on its report on Lessons Still to be Learned from the Chilcot Inquiry, then from the Health Committee Chair, Dr Sarah Wollaston, on its report on Suicide Prevention.\nThe rest of the day is devoted to a six hour debate on a motion from the Conservative,  John Penrose, Labour's Caroline Flint and the SNP's Patricia Gibson, deploring the big six energy firms' treatment of out-of-contract energy customers on default tariffs.\nWith energy bills taking an ever increasing share of the incomes of the poorest households, the motion calls for immediate action to protect consumers from being marooned on expensive default tariffs and calls on the industry, regulators and the government to consider solutions which recognise that many people lead busy lives where switching their energy supplier may not always be a high priority.\nIn Westminster Hall (1.30pm) MPs debate the Transport Committee's report on improving the rail passenger experience, and then Jobcentre Plus office closures (3pm).\nIn the Lords (11am) questions to ministers include one from Lib Dem superlawyer Lord Lester on the introduction of legislation to give effect to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights on prisoners' voting.\nThen, peers consider three orders on combined authority arrangements for Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield; for Liverpool City region; and for Tees Valley. The main business for the day is a debate on the Commonwealth and the importance of strengthening the UK's relations ahead of UK hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Government summit, in 2018.\nNeither House sits on Friday.", "summary": "\nAfter six weeks of debate across both Houses of Parliament it looks like the Brexit Bill, the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, which gives the prime minister the power to begin the UK's divorce from the EU, is about to complete its passage through Parliament.\n\n"}

{"id": "39328073", "document": "Brexit - rejected by 55.8% of voters in Northern Ireland - is seen as just the latest imposition by England.\nIt has given a new momentum to their whole reason for existing: the belief the island of Ireland should be one country.\nEverywhere down the Falls there are reminders of those who killed and died for a united Ireland: here a mural of a young man with a rifle, there a huge sepia portrait celebrating the provisional Irish government set up in 1922.\nBut there are new signs too, lots of them. Sinn Fein's latest posters say West Belfast stands against Brexit.\nThe referendum has changed politics here, as all over the UK, even on party night.\nThe West is gyrating in a sea of joyous green on St Patrick's Day. The social club on the Falls Road in Belfast is packed full of people dancing and drinking.\nSome merely wear a token green T-shirt or badge, but several women are in elaborate emerald dress, men in bowlers or stetsons of the appropriate shade: any culture you like as long as its Irish. Inevitably one man is dressed as that most emerald of animals, a crocodile.\nHere even the plush is political. It's the greatest day of the year, says one woman: about Irishness, about all of Ireland. Does she feel British at all, I ask .\n\"Not at all, definitely Irish.\"\nBritish as well as Irish? I ask another reveller.\n\"No, no, pure Irish.\"\nAnd another tells me: \"Irish 100%.\"\nWhat Mrs May calls the UK, the \"precious union of nations… the most successful the world has ever known\", is seen very differently here.\nThey are in no doubt about Brexit, either - they are against it, unless you mean exiting from Britain, casting off what they see as the last shackles of the English Empire.\n\"We're not the UK, we're Ireland. We should have the right to vote. Theresa May is a fascist,\" one man tells me.\nThey fear a return to a real border between the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\"Borders! Nobody wants 'em. We're nationalists here. Loyalist don't want it. Business people don't want it.\"\nHence the renewed demand for an all-Ireland referendum is being made by Sinn Féin as they look to exploit their success in the recent elections.\nYou can believe they pulled out of Stormont in a row over an obscure environmental scheme if you want. But the real story is deeper. Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister over the handling of the botched energy scheme that could cost £490m. But others forces were also in play.\nSinn Fein activists were increasingly feeling they got little out of devolution, that their partners in government, the DUP, were treating them without respect. So they brought the whole thing crashing down.\nIf they do not do a post-election deal in the coming weeks then there will have to be new elections or London will take over: that's called \"direct rule\". The prime minister appears to have ruled that out.\nThe negotiations are a poker game but Sinn Fein has little to lose by blinking first. Their supporters want real movement on issues dear to their hearts, and a re-run of the election might see them increase their vote.\nThe real thorny issues are old ones, about the role of the Irish language and what are known euphemistically as \"legacy issues'': whether people should face criminal prosecution for what they did during the Troubles.\nThe DUP's Nelson McCausland, who lost his assembly seat at the recent election, say this is not an opportunity for Sinn Fein, but a full stop.\n\"There has been over a number of years within Sinn Fein a concern they had not delivered on their united Ireland dream. What they have used over the years is the European Union and European harmonisation to promote the idea that we are being harmonised with the Republic. Brexit puts a stop to that.\"\nUnionists hardly need to argue against the call for a referendum. The British secretary of state only needs to agree to one if, in the words of the act \"it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting\" want a united Ireland. Pretty hazy. And not a single opinion poll or commentator suggests there is that majority.\nBut the next day I return to the Falls and find a different picture at a language school from the hard line espoused by some of those at the West social club. Five people and their teacher sit around the table practising their Irish conversation. Among them, Linda Ervine who's been learning the language for six years.\n\"Because I am from the Protestant community I never had the opportunity to engage with the language and I fell in love with it.\"\nShe says there are many links with her own heritage. \"We've been very separate, British identity, Irish identity but in the last few years a Northern Irish identity is coming through more and more. For me I see myself as Irish and British, I don't see that as a contradiction.\"\nAnd there's the flood of people - including many Unionists and Protestants - applying for Irish passports in the wake of Brexit. The Belfast Newsletter newspaper's Sam McBride sees big changes under way.\n\"Unionism is facing a crisis at the moment, a seismic change.,\" he said. \"The fundamental question is that there is a significant number of Catholics who support the union with the United Kingdom - why are they not voting for unionist parties? I think the answer is the trappings of Orangism and Protestantism put those people off.\"\nThere are straws in the wind across the border too. The cabinet in Dublin decided that eventually all Irish passport holders, including in the North, will be able to vote in presidential elections. The opposition party Fianna Fail is preparing is own white paper on plans for a united Ireland.\nBut Republican commentator Chris Donnelly, like most observers on both sides of the divide, thinks there will not be a referendum, and it couldn't be won because many from that tradition feel more economically secure in the North.\n\"I think Sinn Fein know in their heart of hearts they are 20, 25 years away from when a border poll could actually have a credible chance of being won. It's an example of \"Hail Mary\" politics. It's a lottery move, its not going to happen but it is keeping the issue alive at the centre of political discussions.\"\nWhile we all get used to all new politics of identity, it has been the language of debate in Northern Ireland for centuries.\nBrexit has muddied the political waters. And a new political space may be up for grabs.", "summary": "\nOn the Falls Road, heart of Republican Belfast. there's a new sense of purpose.

Science teams are expected to put together proposals which would be evaluated by experts working for Nasa.\nAbout 10 proposals could be selected to go forward to the next stage.\nLast year, in response to a congressional directive, Nasa outlined its concept for how a landing mission would work.\nThe report calls for a four-legged lander that would hunt for evidence of microbial life on Europa's surface. It would touch down with the help of the Sky Crane system used to deliver the Curiosity rover to Mars in 2012, but would use a much longer tether to minimise contamination of the Europan surface with rocket fuel.\nThe lander would carry some heritage from Nasa's Phoenix lander, which touched down in Mars' \"arctic\" in May 2008. That mission used a motorised cutting tool called a rasp to break up the hard, icy soil along with a scooper to retrieve the samples for analysis.\nThe Europa lander will carry a counter-rotating saw in addition to Phoenix's flight-tested rasp and scoop. Scientists want to dig at least 10cm below the radiation-processed ice, but comparatively little is known about Europa's surface properties.\nWith temperatures that dip to -170C, however, engineers have to prepare for the eventuality of steel-hard ice that resists Nasa's best efforts to dig through.\nHowever, scientists believe that if there is any life near the surface, they could detect it at concentrations of at least 100 microbial cells per cubic centimetre of ice. Although Europa's icy outer shell is thought to be tens of kilometres thick, studying the surface could provide clues to what's going on deep below.\nWarm blobs of ice, or diapirs, could well up from the ocean-ice shell interface, eventually reaching the surface over thousands of years - carrying any evidence of microbial life with them.\nEarlier this year, Nasa programme scientist Curt Niebur told me: \"The lander is all about hitting the freshest, most pristine sample possible. One way to do that is to dig deep, another way is going to where there is some kind of eruption on the surface - like a plume - that's dropping very fresh material onto the surface.\"\nThe Hubble telescope has provided tentative evidence for geysers that spew ice out into space from deep beneath Europa's surface.\nThe lander would follow several years after a flyby mission called Europa Clipper, which is scheduled to launch in the early 2020s.\nFollow Paul on Twitter.", "summary": "\nNasa is seeking the best ideas for experiments to fly on a mission that will land on Jupiter's moon Europa.\n\n"}

He has pledged allegiance to IS and Philippine Solicitor General Jose Calida said IS had designated him its leader in the Philippines.\nWhen the raid failed, dozens of gunmen came out on to the streets of Marawi, reportedly flying IS flags. Buildings were burned, prison inmates freed and hostages taken as the militants battled troops across the city.\nAt least 11 soldiers and 31 militants had been killed, a military spokesman said. It is not clear if any civilians are among the dead. Thousands of residents have fled from the city.\n\"We were preparing for exams and we could hear the gunfire and bombs,\" one student who evacuated told Reuters news agency. \"We were so scared and so were our Muslim brothers and sisters. We were sure they would get to us.\"\nPresident Duterte imposed martial law in Mindanao on Tuesday in response to the violence.\nMartial law allows the use of the military to enforce order, and the detention of people without charge for long periods. Mr Duterte said it was needed to safeguard national security.\nMindanao is home to several Muslim rebel groups fighting for greater autonomy. The main ones are now holding peace talks with the government but some smaller, more hardline groups remain active.\nLinks between some of these groups and those from Indonesia and Malaysia go back many years, predating the formation of IS.\nBut Mr Calida, the solicitor-general, said domestic rebels had subscribed to the ideology of IS and the situation was evolving.\n\"What is happening in Mindanao is no longer a rebellion of Filipino citizens. It has transmogrified into an invasion by foreign fighters,\" he told a news conference. \"They want to make Mindanao part of the caliphate.\"\nThe admission confirms what observers see as moves by IS targeting Muslim-majority parts of the southern Philippines to establish a stronghold in South-East Asia.\n\"It is clear that the number of men from both Indonesia and Malaysia who have travelled to Mindanao has increased over the past year,\" Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta, told the BBC.\n\"And it's crucial that the government acknowledges that there is a serious IS problem in the Philippines,\" she said, saying much better co-ordination between local and national authorities was needed to deal with the situation.\nShe warned that images of militants in Marawi were already having an impact on social media, working as PR for the militant groups. \"There's a lot of praise and enthusiasm,\" she said.\nA Philippine military spokesman, however, said that while the groups in Marawi were inspired by IS, they had not seen \"any concrete evidence of material support from IS\".\nWith fighting ongoing in Marawi, Mr Duterte said on Friday he was willing to talk to the militants. \"My message mainly to the terrorists on the other side is we can still solve this through dialogue,\" he said.\nBut he has also indicated that martial law could be expanded to the rest of the country if he felt it was necessary, a potentially controversial move in a nation that spent almost a decade under martial law under Ferdinand Marcos.\nOn Friday, former President Fidel Ramos, who served under Marcos but then helped oust him, warned against the use of martial law.\n\"Let us not talk about spreading it to the... rest of the Philippines.

You're logging into your iPad here - you've announced a major policy and you don't know how much it will cost?\" presenter Emma Barnett said.\n\"Can I give you the exact figure in a moment, please?\" the Labour leader said.\nAsked whether this indicated that voters should not trust Labour with their money, he answered: \"Not at all.\"\nHe argued that investing in children in early years meant they did better in school and added: \"I want to give you an accurate figure.\"\nEventually, Ms Barnett quoted shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, who was on BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier: \"£2.7bn, then £4.8bn... with half a billion to reverse cuts to the Sure Start scheme. Does that sound about right?\"\n\"It does sound correct,\" Mr Corbyn said.\nAnalysis - BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith\nThis was on a par, or possibly even worse, than Diane Abbott getting into a pickle on the cost of Labour's policing pledges.\nThat's not just because Jeremy Corbyn is the party leader, but also because childcare is an absolutely key pledge, he's campaigning on it today - and he was clearly struggling badly for the numbers.\nWhen you get the leader struggling to say how much a core Labour policy is going to cost it sparks questions about how clear, how thorough, how credible its spending plans are.\nDuring a later event in Watford, Mr Corbyn apologised for failing to recall the cost of his party's childcare policy.\n\"I didn't have the exact figure in front of me, so I was unable to answer that question, for which obviously I apologise,\" he said, adding that it was \"unacceptable\" that Ms Barnett had reportedly been subject to abuse on social media for her grilling of the Labour leader.\nThe Labour leader has put the creation of a \"national education service\" at the heart of his party's election campaign.\nThe extension of childcare would benefit more than 1.3 million children - at the moment only 40% of two-year-olds qualify, according to Labour.\nLabour's shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner defended Mr Corbyn's stumble over the cost of his party's childcare policy, telling BBC2's Daily Politics: \"It wasn't that the figure wasn't there. It wasn't the figure hadn't been costed. Look this is a rapid fire general election campaign in which people, politicians are under spotlight.\"\nDuring the Woman's Hour interview, Emma Barnett also asked Mr Corbyn about Labour's manifesto pledge to renew Trident, despite CND's website saying that he was still vice president.\nThe Labour leader, who voted against the renewal of Trident, said he was a member of CND, but added: \"I don't think I'm vice president\".\nFor the Conservatives, International Development Secretary Priti Patel said Mr Corbyn's \"chaotic radio interview with Emma Barnett\" showed the British people \"why he is simply not up to the job of being the prime minister\".\nMr Corbyn was interviewed on the One Show on Tuesday evening, where he said the prospect of becoming prime minister did not fill him with fear but \"hope of what we can do and what we can change in this country\".\nHe also made a joking reference to strife within the party, saying 10-year-olds were easier to control than Labour MPs.\nThe interviews followed a high-profile grilling in a Channel 4/Sky News TV special on Monday when Mr Corbyn, and Conservative leader Theresa May, faced questions on range of subjects, including Brexit and foreign policy, from a live studio audience in the special general election programme on Monday night.\nMr Corbyn was quizzed about his views on drone strikes, tax-raising plans and past campaigning in Northern Ireland.\nMrs May was questioned about social care reforms and was repeatedly asked if she had changed her mind on Brexit.\nBut the leaders did not appear together, as Mrs May declined to take part in a head-to-head encounter.\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning", "summary": "\nJeremy Corbyn was unable to put a cost on Labour's plan for free childcare for 1.3m youngsters during an interview with BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.\n\n"}

{"id": "40116754", "document": "\"Muslims kill us for being Hindu and Hindus kill us for being chamar,\" says a despairing Shivraj, 60, as he surveys his damaged home.\nChamar is a pejorative caste term, used to describe Dalits (formerly known as untouchables) who work with animal hide.\nIndia's 200 million Dalits have traditionally been at the bottom of the Hindu caste system and for centuries, they were kept in subjugation by the higher castes. Despite laws to protect them, discrimination remains a daily reality for many of them.\nShivraj alleges that his house was targeted by a mob comprising upper caste men from his own village.\nHe vows to \"permanently leave the village and abandon Hinduism if attacks against the Dalits do not end\".\nHe is referring to the attacks on his Shabbirpur village situated near the northern town of Saharanpur, almost 200km (124 miles) from the capital Delhi.\nThe first attack took place on 5 May when the upper-caste Thakurs rallied to commemorate Maharana Pratap Singh, a medieval king. Reports suggest the Dalits objected to the rally, which then sparked off clashes between the two communities.\nShimla Devi, 65, shows me her plastered right hand. She says she was beaten up after she tried to prevent the Thakurs from desecrating the village's Dalit temple.\n\"They damaged our temple. I was pushed, jostled and received blows to my right hand. It was terrifying.\"\nThe Dalits say more than 50 of their houses were set on fire by Thakurs.\nBut the Thakurs have their own stories of loss.\nA young Thakur man Sumit, was beaten to death. A father of two children, Sumit, 27, was not even part of the rally. His wife Sunita says her husband was there to meet her aunt but was \"ferociously attacked by the Dalits\".\nThe Dalits deny the allegations.\nViolence broke out again on 23 May when leading Dalit politician and former state chief minister Mayawati visited the village.\nSomeone opened fire on the crowd, killing a teenage boy and injuring several others.\nPolice say they are investigating allegations that it was a \"revenge attack\" carried out by the Thakurs.\nShabbirpur village has been tense for more than a month now. Home to around 3,500 people, it's a small village by Indian standards. And yet it is a microcosm of the tensions of its caste system.\nThe Dalits live in smaller, semi-permanent houses. Immediately outside are the colonies of the Thakurs.\nThe Dalit area showed visible signs of damage - missing doors, collapsed roofs and personal possessions strewn about.\nTwo officers belonging to the district administration, armed with files and documents, have descended upon the village urging the Dalits to let the administration help clean up the village.\nShivraj is not interested. \"The government is embarrassed. The Dalit houses are razed. It's very bad publicity for the new state government. That is why they want to clear all the houses of debris,\" he tells me later.\nThe officials meanwhile explain that the \"help\" doesn't include rebuilding the burnt houses. They are just here to clean up.\nBut despite a long-standing caste division in the village, the violence has taken many by surprise.\nSo what happened? Why did it take a mere religious procession to set off so much violence?\nRaghav Lakhanpal Sharma, a young BJP leader and the MP for Saharanpur, claims it was all orchestrated to defame the recently elected state government.\nMr Sharma accuses Ms Mayawati of using Dalit youth to orchestrate violence in the area in an effort to shore up her once ruling party's flagging popularity.\nHe also blamed the Bhim Army - an organisation of Dalit youth led by charismatic leader Chandrashekhar Azad.\nAmit Lohani, a local leader of the Bhim Army, denies Mr Sharma's allegations.\n\"Bhim Army was formed two years ago to unite Dalit youth and to educate them. It was created to fight the inhuman discrimination being carried out against us by the upper castes,\" he tells the BBC.\nAmitabh Yash, a senior police officer sent by the state government to assess the situation on the ground in Shabbirpur, says however that the Bhim Army was involved in the violence and adds many cases have been registered against them\nBut even Mr Yash admits the caste violence has its roots in the aspirations of those who are tired of having lived in subjugation for centuries.\n\"Old equations are changing. Every community is changing and aspiring to acquire what others have acquired. Everyone wants to be treated equally.\"\nSocial activist Dinkar Pathak agrees.\n\"That's at the heart of recent incidents of violence not just in Shabbirpur but across India. They (Dalits) are coming out on to the streets demanding social justice; they want a share in political power.

I wouldn't even start to think about the mental health issues that everyone has gone through post-Ebola and during it as well.\n\"There's no way I can compare what I've gone through to what they've gone through.\"\nWhen they're reunited, the pair laugh and banter like old friends, holding hands and cuddling one another. During the epidemic, that kind of physical contact infected about 14,000 people and proved deadly to 4,000.\nEbola killed Mbalu's father and sister - the family breadwinners - along with her niece and aunt.

I see Pauline as a hero, because she risked her life to come to our aid.

The buildings were demolished only a few days earlier, to make way for a hospital.\nShe calmly walks around, trying to get her bearings and reflecting on what it was like to work there, wrapped in plastic suits in stifling temperatures and cloying humidity.\n\"The wards seemed quite sombre at times.

It's a place that doesn't hold good memories for many, many people.\"\nPauline fell ill shortly after she returned to the UK and was later charged with misconduct by the Nursing and Midwifery Council for allegedly allowing a wrong temperature to be recorded in the screening process on her arrival at Heathrow.\nAlthough she was cleared, fighting her case stripped her of her life's savings.\nFor the next part of her trip, Pauline travels to Makeni, a large town in the centre of the country.\nPauline has returned to Sierra Leone with the charity Street Child, to participate in the UK-based charity's annual marathon. This year's event saw 600 locals and 170 runners from overseas take part.\nIt's here the \"the craziest marathon in the world,\" passes over dirt roads, winding through tropical forests and into remote villages.\nPauline has had many health problems as a result of her Ebola, including pain in her legs and numbness in her feet.\nDespite this, she paid to enter the 10k part of the run, launching an Everyday Hero fundraising page which currently stands at Â£2,600.\nShe had thought she would need to walk it but gets \"caught up in the moment\" and runs. \"It was great that the community was out encouraging us, pushing us along. It was probably the highlight of the trip,\" she says.\nFor the remainder of her days in Sierra Leone, she visits more charity projects, sitting down with 12-year-old Mariama, a girl who is being cared for - along with her seven siblings - by her grandmother, after losing her parents to Ebola.\nMariama is very shy, but delights Pauline when she murmurs how she'd like to be president of Sierra Leone one day.\nPauline says she feels some dissatisfaction with the situation in the country.\n\"I feel frustrated that the Western world has moved on. They've pulled out, the media's pulled out, most of the aid agencies have pulled out. These people are still living with the aftermath.\"\nBut Pauline is, at least, feeling upbeat about her own prospects.\n\"I'm not too sure what the future is going to hold.

Jeremy Corbyn began the campaign as a leader whose own MPs doubted his ability to do the job and ended looking as if he was really enjoying it.\nWe'll find out on Friday whether any of this matters. Jeremy Corbyn's ability to attract a crowd and energise the left is not in doubt; his ability to win over voters from other parties is less proven.\nIt was, for the Conservative leader, the most important general election in her lifetime. That didn't stop the leader of the Welsh Conservatives Andrew RT Davies going on holiday halfway through the campaign. I suspect we haven't heard the last of that, fuelled by internal disquiet over the admission of Mark Reckless to the Tory group in the Welsh Assembly.\nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron didn't visit the only seat his party is defending in Wales - Ceredigion. The Lib Dems said this was because he was targeting possible gains (it's possible a Ceredigion visit had been scheduled for the days when campaigning was suspended).\nMr Farron went to Montgomeryshire on Tuesday to warn that the Conservatives' so-called \"dementia tax\" would threaten the future of the family farm.  Just one problem - social care is devolved, as the Lib Dems know, but they were not alone in trying to confuse voters over devolved issues in this campaign. Theresa May came to Wrexham to re-shape her social care policy in England.\nPlaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood was everywhere, although she decided against standing in this election. Whether it was the election debates, the Andrew Marr Show, the Daily Politics, Peston on Sunday, Victoria Derbyshire, Jeremy Vine, The World At One, Today or Woman's Hour, she has a bigger UK-wide profile than any other Welsh politician, one that must be the envy of her predecessors and possibly her parliamentary leader Hywel Williams, who is standing in this election but has been rather less visible. Mind you, it didn't stop UKIP leader Paul Nuttall calling her Natalie. We'll find out on Friday whether that Leanne Wood profile translates into votes.\nWhat did we learn from the televised election debates? The biggest headlines were caused by Theresa May's absence. As someone who watches politicians debating with each other for his living, I thought the formats that worked best for viewers were those where a leader was put on the spot by voters rather than exchanged soundbites with their counterparts. My rule of thumb would be this: the more politicians involved in debates, the less illuminating the exchanges.\nThe main manifestos were curious. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Labour's sums don't add up. The Conservatives didn't include any sums to add up.\nThere were detailed Tory pledges in some policy areas, vague ones in others - and some issues went unaddressed. There are a few known unknowns: will the Conservatives protect tax relief on pension contributions? Most of it goes to higher-paid workers and it costs Â£35bn a year.\nAre the Conservatives still committed to cutting the numbers of MPs from 650 to 600 (in Wales from 40 to 29)? If it's in their manifesto, I missed it.\nThere is the question of priorities. Labour are promising an \"alternative Wales Bill\" to rewrite (again) the devolution settlement. I get no sense of timing from the manifesto. I suspect that, whoever wins, Parliament will be so busy with Brexit that other legislative demands have to form an orderly queue.\nSome of the campaign tactics were more effective than others. Do voters care about Jeremy Corbyn's past relationship with the IRA? One Conservative candidate told me that tactic worked well with \"the UKIP demographic\", and there are a lot of UKIP votes to harvest.\nThe campaign was suspended twice in response to terror attacks, which changed the focus of the subsequent arguments.\nIt was unusual in many ways. Bill Clinton's team used to say it was \"the economy, stupid\" that decided elections but the economy was far from centre stage this time. Debt and the deficit that featured so strongly two years ago barely got a look in.\nAnd then there was Brexit, the reason Theresa May gave for calling this unscheduled election. On the last day of campaigning she reverted to her core campaign theme: who do you trust to get the best Brexit deal?\nBut we may be little the wiser about what that deal looks like - or how it could be secured - until negotiations begin. Whoever wins on Thursday, there are 27 other countries who want to have a say.", "summary": "\nIt has been an election campaign like no other, with more than the usual twists and turns amid the slogans in the weeks before polling day.

It also has the backing of President Donald Trump.\nBut Mr Merski, the lobbyist for smaller community banks, said he believed there was bipartisan support in the Senate for some reform - at least for community banks, whose numbers have shrunk in recent years.\nBarney Frank, the former US congressman from Massachusetts who was an architect of the Dodd-Frank law, told the BBC he thinks there is cross-party backing for giving support to smaller institutions.\nBeyond that, he said, Thursday's vote was \"theatre\" that gives strict anti-regulation conservatives their moment: \"It has no chance of becoming law.\"\nMs Weintraub said she remains worried the proposals will advance.\n\"We're concerned and we will be working hard to make sure it doesn't go anywhere,\" she said.", "summary": "\nA Republican push to overhaul US banking rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis may be gaining momentum.\n\n"}
{"id": "40181513", "document": "The ball from Liam Plunkett that jumped up and hit Ross Taylor on the grille of his helmet was an outrageous delivery. You shouldn't see a ball doing that, and to see one do so at almost 90 miles an hour was frightening. Thank goodness Taylor had that protection in place.\nBut it was just a ball that behaved strangely. The ball did not go through the top of the pitch, nor did it leave a mark. It was unsettling, but New Zealand's batsmen then let it unsettle them too much.\nTaylor and his skipper Kane Williamson were putting together a solid partnership in pursuit of England's 310 all out. That ball seemed to get inside their heads.\nThere was poking at the pitch, there was prodding it. There were words with the umpires, and there was shaking of heads.\nWhen Williamson was then surprised by some extra bounce from Mark Wood and caught behind by Jos Buttler, his reaction indicated that the pitch had been to blame.\nI don't believe it had been. Instead, Wood had produced an excellent piece of bowling.\nIt was the classic cross-seam delivery, something Stuart Broad has always said works well at this ground, something that England reach for quite a lot in one-day cricket.\nIt's not a new tactic - Andy Roberts used to slip it in for the West Indies off his bouncer, reasoning that if the ball landed on the shiny portion it could skid on and surprise the batsmen with pace, and that if it landed on the seam it could jump up and cause them a different sort of problem.\nOn pitches like this, it can grip a little. It can stick and bounce, and that's what happened to Williamson.\nAgain, no mark. Again, no puff of dust.\nWhat surprised me was Williamson's reaction. For the team's captain and leading batsman to gesture as he did sent a bad vibe to the dressing room, as if to excuse further struggles, as if to say, this isn't our fault.\nBy contrast, England produced a polished team display. It wasn't an overwhelming total that they made, but neither was it shocking.\nIt was middling, daft though that sounds when they went past 300, and it was hard to call how effective it might be; Cardiff is notoriously hard to read, with its short straight boundaries to draw in the big hitters.\nAmong England's bowlers, I thought Adil Rashid deserves special praise. Having been left out for England's opening match against Bangladesh at The Oval, he was brought back in conditions less obviously conducive to his skills.\nHe dealt with them superbly, demonstrating once again that all that hard work he and the England coaches have put in over the past two years has paid off.\nHe has a wrong 'un that even good batsmen cannot pick, and in the shorter forms of cricket that is a wonderful weapon for a leg-spinner to have in his armoury.\nIt all means that England supporters can be genuinely optimistic about their team's chances as they move into next week's semi-finals.\nThey have justified their billing as pre-tournament favourites, and while India have shown that they to deserve to be bracketed in the same league, England will not be intimidated.\nNo matter who they meet in the semis, or where they play them, they will be confident. They know how to win in Cardiff and they love playing at Edgbaston.\nThere are still questions about Jason Roy - once again he got out to a premeditated shot, and I just wish he would get himself in before taking such risks - but the rest of the team has form and a plan that works.\nNow to knock Australia out of the tournament on Saturday. Qualification or not, that match can never be a meaningless fixture or one they will be happy to lose.\nJonathan Agnew was talking to BBC Sport's Tom Fordyce", "summary": "\nThere was much disquiet from New Zealand's batsmen about the Cardiff pitch after their 87-run defeat by England, but to me it was clear: this was absolutely a fair track, and England's progression to the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy is entirely deserved.\n\n"}

{"id": "40233864", "document": "Their fingerprints were all over several of Mrs May's policies and they had a very firm grip on the keys to her door.\nThe close-knit trio - made up of the bearded Brummie big-thinker Nick Timothy, the boisterous and cavalier Scot and former hack Fiona Hill, and their boss, Theresa May - go back seven years to when they all worked together at the Home Office.\nBoth Ms Hill and Mr Timothy already had roles within the Conservative Party before becoming the then-home secretary's special advisers.\nWith a first-class degree in politics, Mr Timothy had entered the party's research department and was already known to have advised May on a range of issues when she was in the shadow cabinet.\nFollowing her work as a journalist, Fiona Hill had swapped sides to become a Tory press officer.\nOnce appointed as Theresa May's joint chiefs-of-staff - in a department tasked with keeping citizens safe and secure - both Ms Hill and Mr Timothy were adamant their boss would be heavily protected too. One former minister told me they were \"her Praetorian Guard\".\nCoalition in 2010 brought the need for partnerships in power but within 24 hours of his new ministerial post at the Home Office, the Liberal Democrat Norman Baker said Mrs May's coterie had already briefed against him in the press.  He battled to influence policy but found it akin to \"walking through mud\".\nIt's difficult to tell whether the stubbornness Theresa May displayed at times - I was told by one former government adviser \"turning her is like turning the Titanic\" - rubbed off on her advisers or whether it was already their style.\nSuch close teamwork often results in close political confidants becoming a reflection of their master's image.\nA former senior Tory insider said they ran the operation with unremitting hostility towards people and told me \"they thought it was advantageous to pick fights in empty rooms\".\nReflecting on their resignations, the adviser gave this assessment: \"Ultimately you need political capital and coalitions in politics and they didn't have that and that's why they had to go so quickly.\"\nBut during their time in office, those same close relationships meant Mrs May's key advisors' personal beliefs were to help shape government policy.\nIssues like promoting grammar schools, combating mental illness, the Modern Slavery Act, stop and search reforms, a reticence towards nuclear power - all stemmed from May's \"enforcer and brains trust\" team of Nick and Fiona, as one former adviser said.\nBut after four years, their tight teamwork was abruptly ended, for the first time, when the behind-the-scenes tactics came to the fore.\nFiona Hill resigned after briefing on an increase of extremism in schools, publicly pitting her boss against the then-Education Secretary Michael Gove.\nNick Timothy soon left too after a row with the party when he refused to campaign against UKIP in a by-election.\nBut it was the uncharted political landscape caused by the Brexit vote that threw them an unexpected lifeline back into mainstream politics.\nAs soon as David Cameron announced his resignation, hours after he lost the vote in 2016, they were drafted in to run Theresa May's Conservative leadership campaign.\nSoon after, they followed Theresa May into No 10 and their influence has been immense.\nIn fact, a picture soon emerged of their overarching power over the PM's policies, diary and decision-making.\nOne former minister complained to me that \"nobody could get access to them - including her own ministers\".\nAs an illustration of what the relationship was like between Ms Hill and the prime minister, I was told by a number of sources that Ms Hill would on occasion boss her boss around. A former minister said Fiona Hill would \"tell her what to do and tick her off\".\nI asked if anyone else did that to Mrs May. \"No-one else other than her husband,\" my source replied.\nOne Tory insider who knows both Fiona Hill and Alastair Campbell well had an interesting observation about how each dealt differently with selling tough news.\nWhere Tony Blair's so-called bodyguard would try to deploy charm, Ms Hill could become \"aggressive\".\nI'm told it wasn't just in her dealings with the press but also with senior cabinet ministers, either in person or via text messages.\nThis sort of behaviour may have, in the end, undermined the many successes the team enjoyed, and made surviving a bad election result almost impossible.\nAs Mr Timothy wrote as he announced his resignation, the trio had just helped win \"more than 13.6 million votes, which is an historically high number, and more than Tony Blair won in all three of his election victories\", only to be thwarted by \"an unexpected surge in support for Labour\".\nPerhaps too they were thwarted by a lack of goodwill among even the closest of co-workers.\nBy overseeing policy in the much-criticised election manifesto, Nick Timothy undoubtedly made some mistakes, leaving the prime minister exposed.\nOne former government adviser told me privately that Mr Timothy and Ms Hill weren't solely to blame for the problems besetting the beleaguered PM but they were a significant part.\n\"Like their boss,\" the adviser said of the PM's gatekeepers, \"they skated on foundations a mile wide and an inch thick. They lacked flexibility, charm and a listening mode. Hill in particular never understood you don't have to shout, you have to communicate.\"\nSo how will Theresa May cope without them?\nHer colleagues will be looking for her to become more collegiate. A former minister said she has not spent much time cultivating friends in Parliament, leaving her without many.\nWithout Nick Timothy's presence, we may start to notice shifts in government policy, such was his influence - including on big-ticket items like the government's approach to the Brexit negotiations.\nMuch will of course be determined by who Mrs May picks as their replacements, but it's too early to say how comfortable she will be surviving without them.", "summary": "\nTheresa May's two key advisers have resigned after a disastrous election campaign.

{"id": "40306837", "document": "Those days are long gone.\nSurrounded by drab suburbs and urban motorways it now caters mainly for private jets, whose passengers spend as little time as possible amid its rather bleak and windswept surroundings - although it does have a rather good aviation museum.\nBut for the next week Le Bourget will become the beating heart of the global aerospace industry.\nScores of politicians - including newly elected President Macron - generals and chief executives will be among the hundreds of thousands of visitors, braving horrendous traffic and negotiating tight security to attend the 52nd Paris Air Show.\nSo what will be the main talking points in the plush chalets and teeming exhibition halls this year?\nTraditionally, the headlines are dominated by big order announcements from home favourite Airbus and the US aerospace giant Boeing, but the market is far less frothy than it used to be.\nGlobal aircraft orders have declined by about half since their peak in 2014. Low oil prices mean that airlines are under less pressure to replace old aircraft with newer, more efficient models.\nSo we may see fewer announcements.\nThat isn't a huge problem in itself - both manufacturers already have bulging order books, and both have struggled with supply chain problems, causing delays on the production line. So a reduction in demand may be no bad thing.\nHowever that doesn't apply across the board. The giant A380 superjumbo is the flagship of the Airbus fleet - and its appearance is usually a highlight of the air display.  But it isn't selling well and last year the company halved its annual production.\nIt would doubtless love to announce further orders in Paris but that seems very unlikely. In fact, some are questioning whether the aircraft has a future at all.\nIn the circumstances, Airbus could well find itself upstaged by its American rival. Boeing is expected to set out details of a planned new mid-sized aircraft, a super-efficient model which will sit between the smallest 787 and the largest 737 in its range.\nMeanwhile the latest in a series of heavily upgraded 737 models - the Max 10 - is likely to be formally launched at the show.\nYet the two established giants could be forgiven for looking nervously over their shoulders.\nChina's Comac and Russia's Irkut have both begun testing new airliners over the past few weeks. Neither the C-919 nor the MC-21 will be at the show - but they will certainly be talked about. The market for smaller jets is about to become a lot more crowded.\nWhile most of the actual business at Le Bourget is done in the chalets and exhibition halls, the flying display allows companies to show off their latest multi-billion dollar technology.\nAmong the highlights this year will be the F-35 Lightning II, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter.\nIt is the product of the world's most expensive defence programme, an international effort led by the US contractor Lockheed Martin - and one which has been beset by delays and cost overruns. It badly needs some good PR, so it can be expected to put on a spectacular show.\nElsewhere, much of the talk will focus on new technology.\nOutwardly, aircraft may have changed little over the past few decades. But the way in which they are designed, built, maintained and operated has been transformed. That trend is likely to accelerate.\nMany of the exhibitors will be showing how virtual reality, augmented reality and 3D printing are already having a major impact on different parts of the industry - and suggesting how their potential could be exploited even further.\nFor some the future lies in Big Data; analysing huge reams of information to detect patterns, create models and to predict future performance.\n\"The amount of data this industry generates is massive and growing,\" says John Schmidt, managing director of Accenture's aerospace and defence business.\n\"A single flight by a Boeing 787 generates enough data to fill about 200 DVDs\", he says. \"But very little of that data is actually used.\"\nBig data, he thinks, can transform the way aerospace companies operate.\nThe organisers of the show, Gifas, are also keen to show off their futuristic credentials. For that reason, they have set up an \"Air Lab\" dedicated to new technology and ideas, from both established companies and start-ups.\nWith a rather nice touch, they've put it inside Le Bourget's Concorde Hall - an area dominated by two models of the supersonic airliner that was once ahead of its time, is now obsolete, but still manages to look outrageously futuristic.", "summary": "\nThe Paris airport of Le Bourget was once a pretty glamorous place.

{"id": "40479686", "document": "Every year, tens of thousands of Americans die from opioid overdoses, devastating families and communities along the way.\nThe number of deaths involving opioids - a class of drug covering everything from heroin, to legal painkillers - has quadrupled since 1999, a White House commission said in a draft report, urging President Trump to declare a national emergency.\nThe Health Strategy Group which we jointly chair at the non-partisan think tank the Aspen Institute, has also been looking at the options for tackling a problem which shows no signs of abating.\nThese are its five key ideas.\nOpioids are easy to prescribe, prescriptions easy to fill, and most people find their health insurance readily covers the costs.\nNearly 250m prescriptions for opioids were written in the US in 2015 - far more, per capita, than in other countries.\nAs a result, it is estimated that opioids have become a $10bn (£7.6bn) industry in the US.\nA closer eye on marketing methods and prescription practices could reduce the gap between the amount of drugs prescribed and actual medical need.\nDoctors, dentists and pharmacists have an important role to play, with the head of one pharmacy chain saying that \"an ankle sprain or dental procedure does not call for a prescription of 30 or 60 powerful pain pills\".\nThe White House commission also highlighted the issue of overprescribing, adding that health professionals are often poorly educated about best practice for treating pain and turn to opioids as a result.\nClinical guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been updated to reduce the amount of opioids prescribed for the treatment of chronic pain.\nBut alongside the problem of overprescribing is the issue that alternative methods of treating pain can be more expensive and less likely to be covered by insurance.\nFor example, an individual might be asked to pay $10 (£7.55) towards a 30-day supply of opioids, but $25 (£18.90) or more for a single session of physical therapy.\nThe US opioids epidemic\nOnly one in four people with an opioid problem is actually treated for it, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\nYet there is strong evidence that medication combined with therapy can reduce opioid addiction.\nDrugs such as methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone can all be used to treat people addicted to opioids.\nBut they are best combined with behavioural therapies that teach people how to cope with their problems and motivate them to change.\nHowever, in stark contrast to opioids themselves, such treatment for people with opioid problems is often unavailable.\nLimited insurance cover is often the main barrier.\nOnly about 60% of spending on treatment comes from insurers, with individuals, state and local funds making up the balance.\nThe fear of what other people may think, the failure of doctors to check for substance use and the limited availability of high quality care can also stop people getting treatment.\nOverdoses don't have to be fatal.\nA drug called Naloxone blocks the effects of opioids on the brain and - when administered promptly, by injection or nasal spray - can save lives.\nIt is also available as an auto-injector - an easy to use device a like an EpiPen - which allows people without medical training to inject people who have overdosed.\nWhile Naloxone remains a prescription drug throughout the US, the Food and Drug Administration is exploring ways to make it more readily available.\nFor example, it is encouraging manufacturers to submit plans for an over-the-counter version, which could be bought without a prescription.\nIn 42 states, bystanders found with illegal drugs now have immunity from prosecution if they call for help, or administer Naloxone to someone who has overdosed.\nForty states now allow pharmacists to prescribe Naloxone, or a doctor to issue standing orders rather than individual prescriptions, so that it is easier to obtain.\nA growing number of first responders, including police and fire departments, now stock Naloxone routinely.\nPutting the drug within easy reach in many public places will save lives, just as the widespread distribution of defibrillators helped with cardiac arrests.\nHowever, efforts to distribute Naloxone more widely could be challenged by recent price increases.\nFor example, the price of the auto-injector formulation jumped from $690 (£500) in 2014 to $4,500 (£3,400) in 2016.\nAddiction is a chronic medical condition, but it is often viewed as a moral failing and crime - a factor which can limit access to treatment.\nState and federal prisons hold almost 300,000 people convicted for violating drug laws, with some states far more likely to imprison drug offenders than others.\nIt can also be the case that drug users are not allowed to live in public housing which, in turn, makes their lives less stable and access to support like social services less likely.\nWhile the national government imposes some of its own restrictions, it does allow state and local housing authorities leeway in how they apply rules concerning drug users.\nHowever, nearly all housing authorities \"institute more stringent bans than required by federal law\", a study by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development found.\nSome officials within the criminal justice system have started to look at ways to deal with drug use as a health issue, rather than a purely criminal one - an approach which is worth exploring.\nFor example, a commitment to undergo treatment can be enforced at the time of sentencing and access to such support made available in all prisons.\nSuch approaches have reduced reoffending and give offenders more opportunities when they return to the community, the Federal Bureau of Prisons says.\nThe opioid crisis emerged in large part from poor understanding of how to treat chronic pain.\nRobust research could help to improve the way pain is managed and encourage the appropriate use of opioids.\nMeanwhile, better use of data could help tackle inappropriate prescribing and the diversion of legal opioids into the black market.\nWeak monitoring has enabled doctors and patients to flood the market with prescription opioids.\nEmployers, insurers, and pharmacies all have data that could help build a picture of who is prescribing and using the drugs.\nHowever, that information is all too often held in silos and legal barriers often prevent sharing of data.\nSome of this is beginning to change, with the use of prescription drug monitoring programmes authorised in every state.\nAdditional research is needed to identify best practices and policies for these programmes.\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from experts working for an outside organisation.\nKathleen Sebelius was US Secretary of Health and Human Health from 2009-14 under Democratic President Barack Obama, while Tommy G Thompson held the role between 2001 and 2005, under Republican President George W Bush.\nThey are co-chairs of the Aspen Institute's Health Strategy Group, which describes itself as a non-partisan group of senior leaders in business, health care, technology, academia and the media.\nThis piece was co-authored by Alan Weil, the co-chair and director of the Aspen Health Strategy Group.\nDetails about the funding of the Aspen Institute can be found here.", "summary": "\nThe opioid epidemic has been called the worst ever drug crisis to hit the US.

And what an achievement it is!\nRead the full review here.\nLike all great war films, it's every bit as transfixing up close: at the wheels of the civilian boats scudding across the Channel, inside the cockpits of the fighter planes tearing overhead, and most of all on the beach, with those uniformed boys barely out of their teens, wrestling with the strange notion of defeat with honour even as they fight for their lives.\nFive stars\nRead the full review here.\nIt is Nolan's best film so far. It also has Hans Zimmer's best musical score: an eerie, keening, groaning accompaniment to a nightmare, switching finally to quasi-Elgar variations for the deliverance itself. Zimmer creates a continuous pantonal lament, which imitates the dive bomber scream and queasy turning of the tides, and it works in counterpoint to the deafening artillery and machine-gun fire that pretty much took the fillings out of my teeth and sent them in a shrapnel fusillade all over the cinema auditorium.\nFive stars\nRead the full review here.\nWhere it does deliver on action is in the sky. Today's audiences have spent decades watching digital dogfights in Star Wars movies, themselves originally inspired by World War Two movies such as Twelve O' Clock High. Nolan gets the wow factor back by stripping away the pixels, shooting real Spitfires on real sorties above the real English Channel. The results are incredible, particularly on the vast expanse of an Imax screen, with the wobbly crates veering and soaring above a mass of blue.\nFive stars\nRead the full review here.\nWhat it is, essentially, is 106 clamorous minutes of big-screen bombast that's so concerned with its own spectacle and scale (shot on huge IMAX and 65mm cameras, for big frames and big action) that it neglects to deliver the most crucial element - drama.\nCharacter and plot don't matter because you're there, in the thick of things. It's just like - you guessed it - a video game.  And that, ultimately, is the colossal disappointment at the heart of this movie.\nTwo stars\nRead the full review here (paywall).\nAlthough the film is deeply moving at unexpected moments, it's not due to any manufactured sentimentality or false heroics. Bursts of emotion here explode like depth charges, at times and for reasons that will no doubt vary from viewer to viewer. There's never a sense of Nolan - unlike, say Spielberg - manipulating the drama in order to play the viewer's heartstrings. Nor is there anything resembling a John Williams score to stir the emotional pot.\nRead the full review here.\nIt's a staggering achievement but for some will verge on clinical, particularly as it wraps up in patriotic fervour toward the end.\nIn spite of my want for deeper or more oblique notes in it, Dunkirk is an unbelievably assured and thrilling war film.

Manchester City have surpassed that figure, and Liverpool are willing to pay a club record fee to sign RB Leipzig midfielder Naby Keita.\nBut what about Tottenham Hotspur?\nSince finishing second in the Premier League last season, Spurs have cashed in on right-back Kyle Walker - selling the England international to Manchester City for £45m - but are yet to add to their squad.\nBBC Sport asks why Mauricio Pochettino's side are yet to make their move, what it is like dealing with chairman Daniel Levy, and whether the club needs to invest at all.\nTottenham have been widely linked with Everton midfielder Ross Barkley, and are said to be interested in Estudiantes defender Juan Foyth.\nBut the pattern of recent seasons suggests it may be a while before Levy makes his move, with the majority of Spurs' incoming deals finalised in August.\nLast August, they paid Newcastle £30m for midfielder Moussa Sissoko in the final few hours of the window, having signed £9m winger Georges-Kevin Nkoudou and loan goalkeeper Pau Lopez earlier in the day.\nPrior to that, forward Son Heung-min (£22m), midfielder Erik Lamela (£25.7m),goalkeeper Hugo Lloris (£11.8m) and forward Clint Dempsey (£6m) all joined the club in the closing days and hours of transfer windows.\nFootball agent Jon Smith expects, with transfers at a premium this summer, some clubs may be waiting until late in the window to do their business in the hope fees will fall.\nHowever, he says leaving a deal to be concluded at the last minute makes it \"much, much more difficult\".\n\"The luxury of doing a deal like Kyle Walker in July is you have the time,\" Smith told BBC Sport. \"It's not pressurised. Although you are dealing with people's lives, because the deals are quite complex, it's much easier to put things to the side and deal with them one by one.\n\"If you have three days to go and five deals sloshing around, it's very difficult.\n\"There are two opposites at play. If you have a deal that's not really coming together, the end of the transfer window does focus everyone's attention. You have to put your foot on the gas or take your foot off the accelerator.\"\nOne of the generally accepted rules of football is that doing transfer business with Spurs' chairman is notoriously difficult.\nFormer Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said dealing with Levy over the signing of striker Dimitar Berbatov in 2008 was \"more painful than my hip replacement\".\nBut does he deserve that reputation?\nSmith says Levy \"does everything with a smile\", perhaps because the club's balance sheet is always \"one of the best in the Premier League\".\nTottenham, who are in the process of building a new stadium which is expected to cost £750m, made a post-tax profit of £33m in their latest financial results.\n\"He's a good guy to deal with,\" said Smith. \"He's very savvy on his funding arrangements for the stadium. Of course, they have got to be careful because that's a huge outlay.\n\"He's done a blinding deal on Kyle Walker, so he has definitely got money to spend, but he is not going to be doing Manchester United-type deals this summer.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMatch of the Day pundit Jermaine Jenas said earlier this summer that the wage structure at his former club leaves them susceptible to big-spending clubs looking to \"cherry pick\" their best players.\n\"When I go through the Tottenham team, some of them are already good enough to play for Barcelona or Real Madrid, so you have to start treating them like players of that calibre, or you will lose them,\" said the ex-Spurs midfielder.\nLeft-back Danny Rose, meanwhile, believes his club need \"one marquee signing\" this summer if they want to win silverware next season.\nBut reports suggest Barkley, 23, is asking for £150,000 per week in a deal that would make him Spurs' highest-paid player.\nSmith says Tottenham's form in recent seasons, and the bonus system implemented by Levy, means Spurs still can attract top players without paying them over the odds.\n\"They are on a mission and the atmosphere in the club is sensational,\" he said. \"There is a great team spirit, and that plays to somebody - that's real.\n\"If you go to Manchester United, you have to hope you'll get a game. At Spurs, you're likely to get a lot of games, and then you'll earn your bonuses, and the atmosphere is great and it's London - to a lot of these players, London is the centre of the universe.\n\"Spurs are not a million miles away. When you hear a player is on £100,000 a week, he's probably not. He'll be on £70,000 and the rest is bonuses.\"\nSmith thinks it is unlikely Tottenham, who will play their home games at Wembley next season, will be willing to break their wage structure this summer.\n\"Spurs are on a bit of a dream-chase at the moment, and I think that's got value to footballers, even in this day and age,\" he said.\n\"Daniel is quite good at bonusing people, so that's where they're potentially able to still be in the game at the highest level.\n\"Now is not the time to start breaking structures. If you believe in the club, and believe in where they are going, the bonuses he pays will be higher.\"\nIn the 1990s, Manchester United brought through the famed 'Class of '92' from their youth system, a group including David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and brothers Gary and Phil Neville - all future England internationals - and Wales legend Ryan Giggs.\nBut, more recently, Tottenham have emerged a rich breeding ground for young, English talent.\nYouth product Harry Kane has been the Premier League's top scorer in each of the past two campaigns, while 21-year-old midfielder Dele Alli has won the Professional Footballers' Association Young Player of the Year award in both of his two seasons since joining from MK Dons.\nFootball agent Sky Andrew says Spurs are one of the \"market leaders\" for developing young players, and do not need to spend big this summer.\n\"It's phenomenal what Spurs have done,\" he told BBC Sport. \"What Spurs have done is similar to what Manchester United did in the Beckham and Neville era. Transforming young players into great players.\n\"Fans are excited by numbers. The press make a big story out of numbers, so where there becomes a bit of a grey area is - do supporters want to just see big money being spent? Or do they want to see a club being run properly and developing young players?\n\"It's a bit of a paradox because fans do love seeing their own on the pitch, which is why 'Harry Kane is one of our own' is one of the most popular songs in football. But then fans are also excited by big-money signings.\"\nAndrew says the money being spent this summer is not sustainable, and that more clubs need to follow Spurs' model of developing young talent.\n\"To me, the most important part of football is the development end,\" he said. \"It's a great business model and the fans love it. Of the top half a dozen clubs, Spurs are the market leaders in developing young players.\"\nPhil Neville played for Everton after leaving Manchester United - and says the Toffees should look to adopt Spurs' model of recruitment.\n\"Everton have to look at Tottenham,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\"Four or five years ago, Tottenham and Everton were on similar levels, Tottenham kicked on and Everton didn't but now I think they are well capable of doing a Tottenham - producing a young team with a brilliant manager in Ronald Koeman.\"", "summary": "\nPremier League clubs are spending freely this summer in a bid to muscle in on the top four next season.\n\n"}

However, Dr Levine is concerned that eventually sperm counts could fall in these places too.\nMany previous studies have indicated similar sharp declines in sperm count in developed economies, but sceptics say that a large proportion of them have been flawed.\nSome have investigated a relatively small number of men, or included only men who attend fertility clinics and are, in any case, more likely to have low sperm counts.\nThere is also concern that studies that claim to show a decline in sperm counts are more likely to get published in scientific journals than those that do not.\nAnother difficulty is that early methods of counting sperm may have overestimated the true count.\nTaken together these factors may have created a false view of falling sperm counts.\nBut the researchers claim to have accounted for some of these deficiencies, leaving some doubters, such as Prof Allan Pacey of Sheffield University, less sceptical.\nHe said: \"I've never been particularly convinced by the many studies published so far claiming that human sperm counts have declined in the recent past.\"\n\"However, the study today by Dr Levine and his colleagues deals head-on with many of the deficiencies of previous studies.\"\nBut Prof Pacey believes that although the new study has reduced the possibility of errors it does not entirely remove them.

But it has been linked with exposure to chemicals used in pesticides and plastics, obesity, smoking, stress, diet, and even watching too much TV.\nDr Levine says that there is an urgent need to find out why sperm counts are decreasing and to find ways of reversing the trend.\n\"We must take action - for example, better regulation of man-made chemicals - and we must continue our efforts on tackling smoking and obesity.\"\nFollow Pallab on Twitter", "summary": "\nHumans could become extinct if sperm counts in men continue to fall at current rates, a doctor has warned.\n\n"}

They just have that character and history.\"\nAt 2.7 miles, the track is relatively short for a modern grand prix circuit, and it winds around a dusty natural amphitheatre 12 miles or so outside buzzing, beautiful, historic Budapest, near a water park, whose coloured slides are visible on the hillside from the paddock.\nThe average speed is quite slow, but it's not a slow track. And that's not a contradiction. Yes, some of the corners are slow, but the reason the average speed is relatively low is because there are so many of them, and a fair proportion of them are medium-speed and very demanding.\nThe fast, uphill, blind kink at Turn Four is one of them.

{"id": "40949634", "document": "Before that their mum Helen Peck had never dressed her identical twins in exactly the same outfits.\nWhen the local paper turned up to take photos of the new school entrants, it was Rosie and Mary who were picked out.\nThere is something about twins and the start of the new school year that seems to capture the imagination of the media, and this is not a recent phenomenon.\nEnd of Twitter post  by @greenocktele\nEnd of Twitter post  by @WestLothianCour\nWhen identical twins Dennis and Mark started primary school back in 1972 they too were selected to appear in the local paper.\n\"That was my first recollection of our photograph being in the paper because of us being twins,\" Dennis recalls.\nThe number of identical (monozygotic) twins has actually remained fairly constant across time.\nSo teachers are no more likely to \"see double\" in their classroom today than they were 45 years ago.\nIn the UK, about one in every 250 maternities result in the birth of identical twins.\nHowever, classrooms do have a much greater number of non-identical twins than when Dennis and Mark started school.\nThe number of non-identical (dizygotic) twins increased dramatically in the 80s and 90s in UK.\nDuring this time the number of maternities resulting in multiple births (ie twins, triplets or more) in Scotland rose from 1.04% in 1985 to a rate of 1.42% in 1995.\nEngland and Wales saw a similar rise in the rate of multiple births - 1.01% to 1.41% between 1984 and 1995.\nNon-identical twins account for two-thirds of all the twins born in the UK.\nThis has been attributed to more older women having children, and also an increase in fertility treatment.\nYet this rate of twins is not significantly higher than at previous peaks in the 1920s and 1950s.\nSource: Twins UK\nData for England and Wales, available from 1938, shows the rate of multiple births was between 1.2% and 1.3% until the mid 1950s when there was a sharp decline.\nGRO(S) data suggests the rate of twins in Scotland reached 1.39% between 1916-20, and again from 1946-50 and 1951-55.\nSo although there has been an upward trend since the 1980s, certainly in Scotland, there has not been an unusually high number of twins born in recent decades.\nIn England and Wales, there has been a slow increase in the number of multiple births since 1995, rising from 1.41% to a peak of 1.62% in 2009. Since then the rate has plateaued and in 2015 it sat at 1.61%.\nRecords by the National Record of Statistics suggest that since 1995 the rate in Scotland has fluctuated between a low of 1.37% in 1999 and a high of 1.62% in 2008, and sat at 1.51% in 2016.\nThis means there has been no significant change in the number of twins enrolling in Scottish primary schools for almost 20 years, and in England the increase has been relatively small during this time period.\nYet our nation's fascination with twins in their new school uniform seems set to continue.\nRosie and Mary's mum Helen, who is now Scottish coordinator for Tamba (Twins and Multiple Births Association), says: \"Rosie quite liked the attention to begin with, but Mary found it overwhelming.\n\"I remember her coming home from school and saying 'mum do you ever have one of those days when you want to strip yourself out of your body and shout?

I believe religious education should be given at home, not in schools,\" said the woman, who did not want to be named, due to security concerns.\nOther controversial changes include shortening the time allocated to studying the life of Turkey's secularist founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, an introduction to the concept of jihad and more classes on religion.\nThe coup attempt that took place last year also features prominently in the proposed curriculum.\nThe secular opposition in Turkey says President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the governing AK party are trying to move the country away from its founding values, and make society more Islamic and conservative. Mr Erdogan has repeatedly expressed his ambition to raise pious generations.\nEducation Minister Ismet Yilmaz told the BBC that they had excluded only \"unnecessary, archaic and repetitive subjects\" from the curriculum and that it was not fair to have a debate over a few issues, when more than 100,000 changes had been made.\nMr Yilmaz denied that evolution theory was being completely omitted from secondary education.\n\"We are not against evolution. If science says something, it is impossible to resist it. Also, the subjects on inheritance, mutation, modification and adaptation are still present in the curriculum. These are all within the theory of evolution,\" Mr Yilmaz argued.\n\"We only say this: Let's not teach this subject at this level, but delay it to undergraduate study,\" he added.\nBut critics have argued that the initial chapter on the origins of man has been excluded from the curriculum. Excluding that, but retaining further concepts from the evolution theory, is unhelpful, they say.\n\"Students need to understand the theory of evolution before they can make sense of concepts such as mutation or adaptation. If you do not teach them what evolution is, but talk to them about these subjects, they will be inclined to just memorise, without learning,\" said Aysel Madra from the non-profit think tank Education Reform Initiative.\nHead of Egitim-Is, one of the biggest teachers' unions in Turkey, says the most crucial chapter in the theory of evolution has been dropped.\n\"They want to teach about the origins of man as it is written in religious texts, as if we all descended from Adam and Eve,\" Orhan Yildirim said.\nHe also criticised the introduction of the concept of jihad in secondary school education.\n\"Ask anyone coming out of a mosque today what he understands by the word jihad - 99% would say that they see jihad as the main reason for war in the Middle East. We will not let the government put a spin on the word and normalise the concept of jihad,\" he said.\nAccording to the dictionary of the Institute of Turkish Language, jihad is an Arabic word meaning \"a religious war\".\nEducation Minister Ismet Yilmaz argued that the word was misinterpreted and what it actually meant was to serve the community, to increase welfare, to secure peace and understanding of one another.\nWe are not against evolution. If science says something, it is impossible to resist it. Subjects on inheritance, mutation, modification and adaptation are still present\"\nThe education ministry says the curriculum was changed through consultation with more than 180,000 people, who shared their comments on the draft.\nBut the opposition teachers' unions say they were not consulted, and that preparation of the draft curriculum was not transparent.\nOrhan Yildirim argued the changes to the curriculum were ideological.\n\"This curriculum is a coup d'etat targeting education in Turkey.

If you strike a country's education as such, then it will be impossible for it to catch up with prosperous nations,\" he said.", "summary": "\n\"In Turkey, education was never secular.
